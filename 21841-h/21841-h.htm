<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE WORK OF THE WOLF PACK</h3>

<br />

<p>"Hold up, Bob!"</p>

<p>"Any signs of the lame yearling, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Well, there seems to be something over
yonder to the west; but the sage crops up, and
interferes a little with my view."</p>

<p>"Here, take the field glasses and look; while
I cinch my saddle girth, which has loosened
again."</p>

<p>Frank Haywood adjusted the glasses to his
eye. Then, rising in his saddle, he gazed long
and earnestly in the direction he had indicated.
Meanwhile his companion, also a lad, a native of
Kentucky, and answering to the name of Bob
Archer, busied himself about the band of his saddle,
having leaped to the ground.</p>

<p>Frank was the only son of a rancher and mine
owner, Colonel Leonidas Haywood, who was
a man of some wealth. Frank had blue eyes, and
tawny-colored hair; and, since much of his life
had been spent on the plains among the cattle
men, he knew considerable about the ways of cowboys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
and hunters, though always ready to pick
up information from veterans of the trail.</p>

<p>Bob had come to the far Southwest as a tenderfoot;
but, being quick to learn, he hoped to graduate
from that class after a while. Having always
been fond of outdoor sports in his Kentucky
home, he was, at least, no greenhorn. When he
came to the new country where his father was interested
with Frank's in mining ventures, Bob
had brought his favorite Kentucky horse, a coal-black
stallion known as "Domino," and which
vied with Frank's native "Buckskin" in good
qualities.</p>

<p>These two lads were so much abroad on horseback
that they had become known as the "Saddle
Boys." They loved nothing better than to ride
the plains, mounted on their pet steeds, and go almost
everywhere the passing whim tempted them.</p>

<p>Of course, in that wonderland there was always
a chance for adventure when one did much
wandering; and that Frank and Bob saw their
share of excitement can be readily understood.
Some of the strange things that happened to them
have already been narrated in the first volume
of this series, "The Saddle Boys of the Rockies,
Or, Lost on Thunder Mountain," and which, in
a way, is an introduction to the present story. In
the first book the boys cleared up a wonderful
mystery concerning a great cavern.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>

<p>For several minutes Bob was busily engaged
with the saddle girth that had been giving him
considerable trouble on this gallop.</p>

<p>"There," he remarked, finally, throwing down
the flap as though satisfied with his work. "I
reckon I've got it fixed now so that it will hold
through the day; but I need a new girth, and
when we pull up again at Circle Ranch I'll see
about getting it. Oh! did you make out anything
with the glasses, Frank?"</p>

<p>He sprang into the saddle like one who had
spent much of his time on horseback. Domino
curvetted and pranced a little, being still full of
mettle and spirits; but a very firm hand held
him in.</p>

<p>"Take the glass, and see if you can make out
what it is," Frank remarked, as if he hardly knew
himself, or felt like trusting his eyes.</p>

<p>A minute later Bob lowered the glasses.</p>

<p>"There's something on the ground, and I can
catch a glimpse of what looks like a dun-colored
hide through the tufts of buffalo grass. The
yearling was red, you said, Frank? All right.
Then I reckon we'll find her there; but not on her
feet."</p>

<p>"Come on!"</p>

<p>As he said these curt words Frank let Buckskin
have his head; and, accompanied by his chum,
started at a full gallop over the level, in the direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
of the spot where the dun-colored object
had been sighted.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward they topped a little rise, and
pulled up. No need to doubt their eyes now. Just
before them lay the mangled remains of the lame
yearling, very little being left to tell the story of
how the animal had met its fate.</p>

<p>"Wolves!" said Frank, gloomily, as he sat
looking down at the torn hide.</p>

<p>"I don't know the signs as well as you, Frank,
but I'd say the same from general indications. And
they had a royal good feast, too. This makes a
round half dozen head your father has lost in
the last month, doesn't it?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Seven, all told. When Bart Heminway told
me he had noticed that one of those fine yearlings
seemed lame, I wondered if something wasn't
going to happen to it soon. And then, when we
missed it from the herd last night, I guessed what
had come about. They caught her behind the
rest, and pulled her down. The poor thing didn't
have a ghost of a show against that pack of savage
wolf-dogs."</p>

<p>"I'd like to have just one chance at them, that's
all," grumbled Bob, as he let his hand fondle the
butt of a modern repeating rifle, which he carried
fastened to his saddle.</p>

<p>"This is sure the limit, and it's just got to
stop!" declared Frank, grimly.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>

<p>"Right now?" queried his chum, eagerly.</p>

<p>Two pairs of flashing eyes met, the black ones
sending a challenge toward the blue.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Frank, shutting his jaws
hard, "the day is before us still; and we're well
primed for the business of hunting that pack to
their den. Look at that bunch of rocks a few
miles off; that must be where they hang out,
Bob! Queer that none of the boys have ever
thought of hunting in this quarter for that old
she-wolf Sallie, and her brood."</p>

<p>"Then you think she did it, do you?" asked
Bob.</p>

<p>"Sure she did. You can see for yourself where
her jaws closed on the throat of the poor yearling.
Everybody knows her trademark. That sly
beast has been the bane of the cattle ranches
around here for several years. They got to
calling her Sallie in fun; but it's been serious business
lately; and many a cowboy'd ride two
hundred miles for a chance to knock her over."</p>

<p>"And yet none of the rough riders have even
thought to search that rocky pile for her den, you
say?" Bob continued.</p>

<p>"Why, you see, the killings have always been
in other directions," Frank explained. "Just as
shrewd animals often do, up to now Sallie has
never pulled down a calf anywhere near her den.
I reckon she just knew it might cause a search.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
But this time she's either grown over-bold, or
else the pack started to do the business in spite
of her, and she was forced into the game."</p>

<p>"Well, shall we head for that elevation, and
see what we can find?" asked Bob, who was inclined
to be a little impatient.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit. It would be ten times better if
we could only track the greedy pack direct; but
that's a hard proposition, here on the open,"
Frank observed.</p>

<p>"Well, what can we do then?" his chum asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps put it in the hands of the best trailer
in Arizona," and with a laugh Frank pointed off
to the left.</p>

<p>The Kentucky boy turned his head in surprise,
and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Old Hank Coombs, on his pony, as sure as
anything! You knew he was coming along all the
while, and just kept mum. But I'm sure glad to
see the old cowman right now. And it may turn
out to be a day of reckoning for that cunning
Sallie, and her half grown cubs."</p>

<p>The two lads waved their range hats, and sent
out a salute that was readily answered by the
advancing cowman. Hank Coombs was indeed a
veteran in the cattle line, having been one of the
very first to throw a rope, and "mill" stampeding
steers in Texas, and farther to the west.</p>

<p>He was an angular old fellow, grim looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
in his greasy leather "chaps;" but with a twinkle
in his eyes that told of the spirit of fun that had
never been quenched by the passage of time.</p>

<p>"Howdy, boys," he called out, as he drew rein
alongside the two lads. "What's this here yer
lookin' at? Another dead calf? No, I swan if
it ain't a yearling as has been pulled down now.
Things seem t' be gittin' t' a warm pass when
sech doin' air allowed. Huh! an' it looks like
Sallie's work, too! That sly ole critter is goin'
t' git t' the end of her rope some fine day."</p>

<p>"Why not to-day, Hank?" demanded Frank,
briskly.</p>

<p>The veteran grinned, as though he had half
anticipated having such a question asked.</p>

<p>"So, that's the way the wind blows, hey?" he
remarked, slowly; and then he nodded his small
head approvingly. "Jest as you say, Frank,
thar's no time like the present t' do things. The
hull pack hes been here, I see, an' no matter how
cunning old Sallie allers shows herself, a chain's
only as strong as th' weakest link. One of her
cubs will sure leave tracks we kin foller. All
right, boys count on me t' back ye up. I'll go
wharever ye say, Frank."</p>

<p>"We'll follow the trail, if there is one," said
Frank, instantly; "but the chances are that's
where we'll bring up," and he pointed with his
quirt in the direction of the rocky uplift that stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
like a landmark in the midst of the great level sea
of purple sage brush, marking the plain.</p>

<p>After one good look the cowman nodded his
head again in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Reckon as how y'r' right, Frank," he remarked;
"but we'll see how the trail heads."</p>

<p>Throwing himself from his saddle he bent
down over the remains of the yearling that had
been so unfortunate as to become lame, and thus,
lagging far behind the rest of the herd, fallen a
victim to the wolf pack.</p>

<p>"Easy as fallin' off a log," announced old
Hank, immediately. "Jest as I was sayin', thar's
nearly allers one clumsy cub as don't hev half
sense; an' I kin foller this trail on horseback,
'pears to me."</p>

<p>He ran it out a little way; then, once more
mounting, went on ahead, with his keen eyes
fastened on the ground.</p>

<p>Bob watched his actions with the greatest of
interest. He knew Old Hank was discovering a
dozen signs that would be utterly invisible to one
who had not had many years of practice in tracking
both wild animals and human beings.</p>

<p>Now and then the trailer would draw in his
horse, as though desirous of looking more carefully
at the ground. Twice he even dropped off
and bent low, to make positive his belief.</p>

<p>"I reckon you were right, Frank," remarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
Bob, after half an hour of this sort of travel "because,
you see, even if the trail did lead away
from the rocks at first, it's heading that way now
on a straight line."</p>

<p>"Thet was only the cuteness of the ole wolf,"
said Hank. "She's up t' all the dodges goin'.
But that comes a day of reckonin' for all her
kind; an' her's orter be showin' up right soon."</p>

<p>When another half hour passed the three riders
had reached the border of the strange pile of
rocks. And as Frank looked up at the rough
heap, with its many crevices and angles, he considered
that it certainly must offer an ideal den
to any wild beast wishing to hide through the
daytime, and prowl forth when darkness and night
lay upon the land.</p>

<p>"Here's whar the trail ends at the rocks,"
said Hank, as he dismounted and threw the bridle
over the head of his horse, cowboy fashion, knowing
that under ordinary conditions the animal
would remain there, just as if hobbled, or staked
out.</p>

<p>Both of the saddle boys followed his example,
and, holding their rifles ready, prepared to search
the rocks for some trace of the wolf den. Wild
animals may be very cunning about locating their
retreat in a place where it will be hidden from the
eye of a casual passer; but, in course of time, they
cannot prevent signs from accumulating, calculated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
to betray its presence to one who is keenly on
the watch.</p>

<p>The three searchers had not been moving back
and forth among the piles of rocks more than
ten minutes when Old Hank was observed to
raise his head, smile, and sniff the air with more
or less eagerness.</p>

<p>"Must be close by, boys," he said, positively.
"I kin git the rank odor that allers hangs 'round
the den of wild animals as brings meat home, an'
leaves the bones. The air is a-comin' from that
quarter, an' chances are we'll find the hole sumwhar
over yonder."</p>

<p>"I think I see it," said Frank, eagerly. "Just
above that little spur there's a black looking crevice
in the rock."</p>

<p>"As dark as my hat," added Hank; "an' I
reckon as how that's whar Sallie lives when she's
t' home. Now t' invite ourselves int' her leetle
parlor, boys!"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>RIDDING THE RANGE OF A PEST</h3>

<br />

<p>"Well, what do you think now, Frank?"
asked Bob, as they stood in front of that gloomy
looking crevice, and observed the marks of many
claws upon the discolored rock, where hairy
bodies had drawn themselves along countless
times.</p>

<p>"I'm wondering," the other replied; "what ails
our boys at the ranch never to have suspected
that old Sallie had her den, and raised her broods,
so close to the Circle Ranch. Why, right now
we're not more'n ten miles, as the crow flies,
away from home. And for years this terrible
she-wolf has lived on the calves and partly grown
animals belonging to cattlemen in this neck of
the land. It makes me tired to think of it!"</p>

<p>"But Frank, it's a long lane that has no turning,"
remarked Bob; "and just now we've got
to the bend. Sallie has invited her fate once too
often. That lame yearling is going to spell her
finish, if Old Hank here has his way."</p>

<p>"It sure is," agreed Frank. "And when we
get back home with the hide of that old pest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
fastened to a saddle, the boys will be some sore
to think how anyone of the lot might have done
the job, if they'd only turned this way."</p>

<p>"But what's Hank going to do?" asked the
Kentucky boy, watching the veteran cow-puncher
searching on the ground under a stunted pinon
tree that chanced to grow where there was a small
bit of soil among the rocks.</p>

<p>"I don't know for a dead certainty," replied
the other; "but I rather think he's picking up
some pieces of wood that might make good
torches."</p>

<p>"Whew! then he means that we're to go into
the cave, and get our game&mdash;is that it, Frank?"
demanded the other, unconsciously tightening his
grip on his rifle, as he glanced once more toward
that yawning crevice, leading to unknown depths,
where the wolf pack lurked during the daytime to
issue forth when night came around.</p>

<p>"That would be just like the old chap, for he
knows nothing of fear," Frank replied; "but of
course there's no necessity for <i>both</i> of us to go
with him. One might remain here, so as to
knock over any stray beast that managed to escape
the attention of those who went in."</p>

<p>"All right; where will you take up your stand,
Frank?" asked Bob, instantly; at which his chum
laughed, as though tickled.</p>

<p>"So you think I'd consent to stay out here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
tamely, while you two were having a regular
circus in there?" he remarked. "That would
never suit me. And it's easy to see that you count
on a ticket of admission to Sallie's parlor, too.
Well, then, we'll all go, and share in the danger,
as well as the sport. For to rid the range country
of this pest I consider the greatest favor under
the sun. But there comes Hank with a bundle
of torches under his arm."</p>

<p>"We're off, then!" chuckled Bob.</p>

<p>"Make sure o' yer guns, lads," said the cowman,
as he came up; "because, in a case like this,
when ye want t' shoot it's apt t' be in a hurry.
An' anybody as knows what a fierce critter ole
Sallie is, kin tell ye it'll take an ounce of lead, put
in the right place, t' down her fur keeps."</p>

<p>"I'm ready," Frank assured the old hunter.</p>

<p>"Then, jest as soon's I kin git this flare goin'
we'll push in." Hank announced.</p>

<p>"Will we be able to see the game with such
a poor light?" asked Bob, a trifle nervously, as
his mind went back to school days, to remember
what he had read of that old Revolutionary
patriot, Israel Putnam, entering a wolf's den
alone, and killing the beast in open fight; truth
to tell Bob had never seen a real den in which
wild beasts hid from the sun; and imagination
doubled its perils in his mind.</p>

<p>"Fust thing ye see'll be some yaller eyes starin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
at ye outen the dark," said Hank, obligingly.
"Then, when I gives the word, both of ye let go,
aimin' direct atween the yaller spots."</p>

<p>"But what if we miss, and the beast attacks
us?" Bob went on, wishing to be thoroughly
posted before venturing into that hole.</p>

<p>"In case of a mix-up," the veteran went on;
"every feller is for hisself; only, recerlect thar
mustn't be any shootin' at close quarters. Use
yer knives, or else swat her over the head with
yer clubbed guns. We're bound t' git Sallie this
time, by hook er by crook! Ready, son?"</p>

<p>Both boys declared that they had no reason for
delaying matters. Since it had been decided as
best to invade the wolf den, the sooner they
started, the better.</p>

<p>True, Bob thought that had it been left to him,
he would have first tried to smoke out the occupants
of the cleft, waiting near by to shoot
them down as they rushed out of the depths. But
then Hank was directing matters now, and whatever
he said must be done.</p>

<p>Besides, Hank had known wolves ever since he
first "toted" a gun, now more than fifty-five
years ago. Perhaps he understood how difficult
it is to smoke out a pack of wolves, that invariably
seek a cave with a depth sufficient to get away
from all the influences of the smudge.</p>

<p>Without the slightest hesitation Old Hank got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
down on hands and knees, and began to crawl into
the gaping mouth of the crevice.</p>

<p>It did not go straight in, but seemed to twist
around more or less. All the while the two boys
kept close at the heels of the guide who carried
that flaring torch. They watched ahead to detect
the first sign of the enemy; and had their ears on
the alert with the same idea in view.</p>

<p>Stronger grew the odor that invariably marks
the den of carnivorous animals.</p>

<p>"We ought to stir her up soon now, Frank,"
whispered Bob, on whom the strain was bearing
hard, since he was not used to anything of this
sort.</p>

<p>"Yes, unless the sly old beast has a back door
to her home; how about that, Hank?" asked the
cattleman's son.</p>

<p>"Don't reckon as how it's so," came the ready
response. "In thet event, we'd feel a breath of
fresh air; an' ye knows as how we don't. Stiddy
boys, keep yer wits about ye! She's clost by,
now!"</p>

<p>"I heard a growl!" admitted Bob.</p>

<p>"And there were whines too, from the half
grown cubs," ventured Frank.</p>

<p>"Once we turn this bend just ahead, likely
enough we'll be in the mess," Bob remarked.</p>

<p>"Range on both sides of me, boys," directed
Hank, halting, so that they could overtake him;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
because he knew full well that the crisis of this
bold invasion of the she-wolf's den was near at
hand.</p>

<p>In this fashion, then, the three turned the rocky
corner.</p>

<p>"I see the yellow eyes!" whispered Bob, beginning
to bring his gun-stock nearer to his
shoulder. "Say, there's a whole raft of 'em,
Frank!"</p>

<p>"Sure," came the quick reply, close to his ear.
"Hank said there was about five of the brood.
Hold your fire, Bob. Pick out the mother wolf
first."</p>

<p>"That's what I want to do; but how can I make
sure?" demanded the Kentucky lad, trying his
best to keep his hands from trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>He had sunk down upon one knee. This allowed
him to rest his elbow on the knee that was
in position, always a favorite attitude with Bob
when using a rifle.</p>

<p>"Take the eyes that are above all the rest, and
which seem so much larger and fiercer. Are you
on, Bob?" continued the other, who was also
handling his gun with all the eagerness of a sportsman.</p>

<p>"Yes," came the firm reply.</p>

<p>"Then let her go!"</p>

<p>The last word was drowned in a terrific roar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
for when a gun is fired in confined space the din
is tremendous. Even as he pulled the trigger Bob
knew that luck was against him; for the animal
had moved at a time when he could not delay the
pressure of his finger.</p>

<p>He heard a second report close beside him.
Frank had also fired, realizing what had occurred,
and that in all probability the first bullet would
only wound the savage beast, without putting an
end to her activities.</p>

<p>The torch went sputtering to the floor of the
cave, having been knocked from the hand of Hank
when the wolf struck him heavily. He could be
heard trying to rescue it before it went completely
out, all the while letting off a volley of whoops
and directions.</p>

<p>Fortunately Frank had kept his wits about him.
And his rifle was still gripped firmly in his hands,
he having instantly pumped a new cartridge into
the chamber after firing. The half grown cubs
showed an inclination to follow their mother in
her headlong attack on the human invaders of the
den; for the numerous gleaming pairs of eyes
were undoubtedly advancing when Frank turned
his gun loose on them.</p>

<p>The din was simply terrific. Bob was more
concerned with the possibility of an attack from
the ferocious mother wolf then anything else. He
had lost track of her after that first furious rush,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
and crouching there, was trying the best he knew
how to locate the creature again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Old Hank had succeeded in picking
up the torch, which, being held in an upright
position, began to shed a fair amount of light once
more.</p>

<p>Not seeing anything else at which he could fire,
Bob now started in to assist his chum get rid of
the ugly whelps that were advancing, growling,
snarling, and in various other ways proving how
they had inherited the fearless nature of the beast
that had nursed them in that den.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was all one-sided, since the animals
never had a chance to get in touch with the invaders.
Neither of the boys ever felt very proud
of the work; but in view of the tremendous amount
of damage a pack of hungry wolves can do on a
cattle ranch, or in a sheepfold, they had no
scruples concerning the matter. Besides, every
one along the Arizona border hated a wolf almost
as badly as they did a cowardly coyote; for
while the former may be bolder than the beast
that slinks across the desert looking for carrion,
its capacity for mischief is a good many times as
great.</p>

<p>"I don't see any more eyes, Frank!" called
out Bob, presently, as he tried to penetrate the
cloud of powder-smoke that surrounded both of
them.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>

<p>"That's because we got 'em all, I reckon," replied
his chum. "How about that, Hank?"</p>

<p>"Cleaned the hull brood out, son," replied the
other, chuckling; "an' no mistake about it either."</p>

<p>"But where did the big one go to; has she
escaped after all?" asked Bob, with a note of
regret in his voice; for he thought the blame would
be placed on him, for having made a poor shot
when he had such a splendid chance to finish the
animal.</p>

<p>"Oh! I wouldn't worry myself about her,
Bob," chuckled Frank, who had already made a
discovery; and as he spoke he pointed to a spot
close by, where, huddled in a heap, lay the heavy
body of the fiercest cattle thief known for years
along the border.</p>

<p>"She was mortally hurted by the fust shot,"
said Hank, as they stood over the gaunt animal,
and surveyed her proportions with almost a touch
of awe; "but seemed like the critter had enough
strength left t' make thet leap, as nigh knocked
me flat. Then she jest keeled over, an' guv up the
ghost. Arter this the young heifers kin stray
away from their mother's sides, without bein'
dragged off. Thar'll be a vote o' thanks sent ter
ye, Bob, from every ranch inside of fifty mile,
'cause of what ye did when ye pulled trigger this
day."</p>

<p>Hank, being an experienced worker, did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
take very long to secure the pelt of the dead
terror of the desert. Then they left the rocks,
finding their horses just where they had left them.</p>

<p>All of the animals showed signs of alarm when
they scented the skin of the wolf; and Domino in
particular pranced and snorted at a great rate
since his education had been neglected in this
particular. So Hank, having the best trained steed
in the bunch, insisted on carrying the pelt with
him on their return trip to the ranch.</p>

<p>Ten miles, as the crow flies, and they would be
at home; and with comparatively fresh steeds,
that should not count for more than an hour's
gallop.</p>

<p>Before they had gone three miles, however, Bob
called the attention of his chum to a horseman
who was galloping toward them. It was a cowboy,
and he waved his broad-brimmed hat over
his head as he came sweeping forward.</p>

<p>"Is he doing stunts; or does he want us?"
asked Bob.</p>

<p>"It's Ted Conway," replied Frank, with a sudden
look of anxiety; "one of the steadiest boys at
the ranch; and he acts as if something had happened
at home!"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>

<h3>THE FLOATING BOTTLE</h3>

<br />

<p>Waving his hat after the extravagant manner
of his kind, the cowboy swept constantly nearer
the little party. Indeed, it was impossible for them
to guess whether Ted Conway bore a message, or
was simply delighted to see the son of his employer,
and his chum.</p>

<p>Presently he reached the constantly advancing
trio, and under the pull of the reins his pony
reared upon its hind legs.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Ted?" asked Frank, immediately.</p>

<p>"Wanted at the ranch, Frank," came the answer.
"The boss has sent me out to look you up
on the jump. Told me as how you started out on
a gallop this way, an' I took chances. Reckon I
was some lucky to strike you so easy."</p>

<p>"But what has happened, Ted?" insisted the
boy, trying to read the bronzed face of the other,
and get a hint as to whether his mission verged
on the serious or not.</p>

<p>It was so very unusual for Colonel Haywood to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
send anyone out to find him, that Frank's suspicions
were naturally aroused.</p>

<p>"Well, the Colonel had a little tumble with
that game leg of his&mdash;same one that the steer fell
on, and broke two years back, in the big round-up&mdash;"
began the cowboy, when Frank interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"Then he must have been seriously hurt this
time, or he wouldn't send you out for me. Tell me
the worst, Ted; you ought to realize that it's
better for me to know it all in the start, than by
degrees. Is my father dead?"</p>

<p>"No. Last I seen of the Colonel, he was a
real live man; only he had his leg done up agin
in splints; an' the ole doc. from the Arrowhead
Ranch was thar, 'tending to him. No, it ain't on
count of his leetle trouble with that leg that
made him send me out huntin' for you, Frank."</p>

<p>"What then?" demanded the boy, curtly; but
with a sigh of relief, for his father was very dear
to him.</p>

<p>"Thar come a messenger to the ranch a while
ago, an' somethin' he fetched along with him,
'peared to excite the boss right from the word
go," Ted admitted.</p>

<p>"A messenger, Ted?" the boy echoed, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Never seen him afore, an' think he kim from
town," the new arrival went on to say. "Leastwise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
he looked like a stray maverick, an' had a
b'iled shirt, with a collar that I reckoned sure
would choke him. Atween you an' me I tried to
get him to chuck the same; but he only grinned, an'
allowed he could stand it."</p>

<p>"Oh! a messenger from town, was it?" said
Frank, with a relieved look. "Then the chances
are it must have been some business connected
with a shipment of cattle. Perhaps the railroad
has had a bad wreck, and wants to settle for that
last bunch we sent away."</p>

<p>But Ted shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>"'T'wan't no railroad man; that I know," he
affirmed, positively. "'Sides, the boss was holdin'
of a bottle in his hand, an' seemed to set a heap
of store by it."</p>

<p>"A bottle, Ted?" cried Frank, deeply interested.</p>

<p>"That's what," replied the cowboy, energetically.
"But jest why he should reckon such a thing
wuth shucks I can't tell ye. But he sent me out
to bring you back to the ranch house like two-forty.
I seen that he was plumb locoed, and some
excited by the news, whatever it might be."</p>

<p>Frank looked at his chum in a puzzled way, and
shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't seem able to make head or tail of this
business, Bob," he remarked; "but there's only
one thing to be done, and that's to romp home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
on the gallop. So away we go with a rush. Who's
after me! Hi! get long, Buckskin! It's a race
for a treat of oats as a prize! Here you are,
Bob; hit up the pace!"</p>

<p>With the words Frank gave his horse free rein,
and went tearing over the level plain, headed as
straight for the distant ranch as though he were
a bird far up in the clear air, and could see to
make a direct line "as the crow flies!"</p>

<p>And after a time, in the distance, they saw the
whitewashed outbuildings of Circle Ranch. Frank
never viewed the familiar and dearly loved scene
with more anxiety than he did now; but so far
as he could see there did not appear to be anything
out of the ordinary taking place around the ranch
house.</p>

<p>"Looks all right, Bob!" exclaimed Frank, as
though a great load had been taken from his
heart.</p>

<p>The sudden coming of Ted Conway, with that
queer message that meant a hurried return, had
mystified the boy not a little. But he knew that
all would soon be made plain now, since they were
nearly home.</p>

<p>Dashing up in front of the house, the two lads
jumped to the ground almost before their mounts
had come to a halt. The door was open, and
Frank led the way in a headlong rush.</p>

<p>As they entered he saw his father seated in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
comfortable easy-chair, with that unfortunate leg,
that had given him more or less trouble for two
years now, propped on another seat, and bound
up.</p>

<p>There was a stranger with him, but no sign of
the Arrowhead Ranch cowboy doctor; which
would indicate that, having done his duty, the roving
physician and bone-setter had returned to his
regular business, which was roping and branding
cattle.</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood was a man in the prime of
life. Up to the time that clumsy steer had broken
his leg he had been most active; but since then he
had not been able to get around on his feet so
well, though able to ride fairly comfortably.</p>

<p>"Hello! Frank, my boy!" he exclaimed, as the
two came rushing in. "So Ted managed to round
you up in great style; did he? Well, I always
said Ted was the sharpest fellow on the range
when it came to finding things. Where have you
been to-day?"</p>

<p>"Doing a little missionary work for the country,"
replied Frank, smiling. "We came across
that lame pet yearling, the dun-colored one you
thought so much of; and there was mighty little
left of the poor beast but a torn hide, not worth
lifting."</p>

<p>"Huh! wolves again!" exclaimed the stock-raiser,
with a frown.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>

<p>"Sure thing, sir," Frank went on. "We saw
a heap of signs that told us our old friend, Sallie,
with the broken tooth, had been on the job again.
But that was the last of our beef the old lady'll
ever taste, or anybody else's, for that matter."</p>

<p>"What's that? Did you sight her, and get a
shot?" demanded the pleased rancher, forgetting
his broken leg in his excitement, and making a
movement that immediately caused him to give a
grunt, and settle back again.</p>

<p>"Old Hank happened to run across our trail
just then," Frank continued; "and we made up
our minds to track the beast to her lair. Where
do you suppose we found it, dad, but in the big
bunch of rocks that lies about ten miles to the
west?"</p>

<p>"You surprise me; but go on, tell me the rest,
and then I'm going to let you in on something that
will open your eyes a little," remarked the stockman.</p>

<p>"Oh! there isn't much more to tell, dad," the
boy hastened to say, for he was eager to learn
what all this mystery meant. "We found the
opening, easy enough, and made up our minds to
crawl in after Sallie, the whole three of us. So
Hank picked up some wood for a flare, and in we
went."</p>

<p>"And you found her home? You met with a
warm reception, I warrant!" the other exclaimed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
his eyes kindling with pride as he saw the quiet,
confident air with which Frank rattled off his
story.</p>

<p>"Sallie was in, ditto five of her half-grown
brood, and all full of fight," the boy continued.
"But of course they didn't have a ghost of a show
against our two repeating rifles. Hank held the
torch, and Bob fired first. Then the brute
jumped, and nearly got Hank, who lost the flare
for a few seconds. We keeled over the ugly
whelps as they started for us; and later on found
old Sallie, just as she had dropped. That big
jump was her last."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to hear that, son," declared
the rancher, who had suffered long and seriously
from the depredations of that sly animal and her
various broods, despite all efforts to locate her,
and put an end to her attacks.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're pleased with what we did,"
Frank remarked.</p>

<p>"It will mean a lot to all honest ranchmen in
this section," continued the cattleman. "With
Sallie gone, we can hope to raise a record herd the
coming season, without keeping men constantly on
the watch, day and night, for a slinking thief that
defied our best efforts. Shake hands, Bob, and
let me congratulate you on making the shot that
ended the loping of the worst pest this country has
known in five years."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>

<p>"But when Ted came whirling along, shouting,
and waving his hat, to tell us you wanted me back
home on the jump, it gave me a bad feeling, dad;
especially when I heard that you'd gone and hurt
that leg again!" Frank cried, as he, too, seized
the other hand of his father, and squeezed it affectionately.</p>

<p>"But I told Ted to be sure and let you know
that it was not on account of my new upset that I
wanted you back," declared the ranchman, frowning.</p>

<p>"Yes, he delivered the message all right, dad;
but all the same I was bothered a heap, let me tell
you," Frank went on. "And now, please, tell us
what it's all about; won't you; and what this
gentleman has to do with it; also the bottle Ted
said you were handling?"</p>

<p>At that Colonel Haywood smiled, and looked
up at the stranger.</p>

<p>"This is a Mr. Hinchman, Frank," he remarked.
"He lives in a small place on the great
Colorado River called Mohave City. And one
day, not long ago, a man who was fishing on the
river at a place where an eddy set in, found a
curious bottle floating, that was sealed with red
wax on the top, and seemed to contain only a piece
of paper. This is the bottle," and as he spoke he
opened a drawer of the desk, and drew out the
flask in question.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>

<p>Frank took it, and turned it around. So far as
he could see it was an ordinary bottle. It contained
no cork, but there were signs of sealing
wax around the top.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hinchman, is, I believe," the ranchman
went on, "though he has been too modest to say
so himself, a gentleman of some importance in
Mohave City, which accounted for the fisherman
fetching his queer find to him. The bottle had
evidently come down the great river, perhaps for
one or two hundred miles, escaping destruction
from contact with rocks in a marvelous manner,
and finally falling into the hands of one who had
both the time and the curiosity to examine its
sealed contents."</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood thereupon took up a small
piece of paper from the pad of the desk.</p>

<p>"This is what he found in the bottle, Frank,"
continued the stockman. "It bore my address, and
the name of my ranch here; so thinking that it
might be something more than a practical joke he
concluded to journey all the way across the country
to see me. It was a mighty nice thing for Mr.
Hinchman to do, and something I am not apt to
forget in a hurry, either."</p>

<p>"Then the paper interested you, dad, it seems?"
Frank remarked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"It certainly did, son, and I rather think you
will feel the same as I did when I tell you whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
name is written at the bottom of this little communication,"
the cattleman went on.</p>

<p>"All right, I'm ready to hear it," Frank remarked,
laughingly.</p>

<p>"Felix Oswald!" replied his father, quickly.</p>

<p>The boy was indeed intensely surprised, if one
could judge from his manner.</p>

<p>"Your Uncle Felix, dad, who has been gone
these three years, and whose mysterious disappearance
set the whole scientific world guessing.
And you say his name is there, signed to that
paper found in the sealed bottle? Well, you sure
have given me a surprise. Then he's still alive?"</p>

<p>"He seemed to be when he wrote this," the
cattleman said, reflectively; "but as he failed to
put any date on it, we can only guess how long the
bottle has been cruising down the Colorado,
sucked into eddies that might hold it for weeks
or months, until a rise in the river sent it forth
again."</p>

<p>"Say, doesn't that beat everything you ever
heard of, Bob?" declared Frank, turning to his
chum.</p>

<p>"It certainly does," replied Bob, and then the
ranchman's boy continued:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you remember me telling you some
things about this queer old uncle of dad's, Bob,
and how, after he had made a name for himself,
he suddenly vanished in a night, leaving word behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
that he was going to study the biggest subject
any man could ever tackle. And as he didn't want
to be bothered, he said he would leave no address
behind. They've looked for him all over Europe,
Asia and Africa, but he was never heard from
again. And now to think that he's sent word to
dad; and in a sealed bottle too!"</p>

<p>"That looks as if he must be somewhere on
the Colorado River, don't it?" suggested Bob.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," replied the stockman; "in fact,
in this brief communication he admits that he is
located somewhere along the Grand Canyon, in a
place where travelers have as yet never penetrated.
I can only guess that Uncle Felix must
have been seized with a desire to unearth treasures
that might tell the history of those strange
old cliff dwellers, who occupied much of that country
as long as eight hundred years ago. All he
mentions about his hiding place is to call it Echo
Cave. You never heard of such a place, did you,
Mr. Hinchman; and you've lived on the lower
river many years?"</p>

<p>"I never did, Colonel," replied the man from
Mohave City; "and perhaps few people have
climbed through that wonderful gash in the surface
of the Arizona desert as many times as I have."</p>

<p>"In this brief note," continued Colonel Haywood,
"Uncle Felix simply says that he has become
aware of the passage of time; and since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
his labors are not yet completed, and he does not
wish to allow his friends to believe him dead, he
has concluded to communicate with me, his nephew.
And as he knew of no other way of doing so, he
resorted to the artifice of the floating bottle."</p>

<p>"Mighty considerate of him, that's sure,"
chuckled Frank. "Been gone now two or three
years, and suddenly remembers that there are
people who might worry about his dropping out
of sight."</p>

<p>"But son," remarked the stockman, "don't
forget that Uncle Felix is wrapped up in his profession,
and cares very little about the ties of this
world. I know him well enough for that. But
it happens, singularly enough, that just now it is
of the greatest importance he should be found,
and communicated with. I would undertake the
task myself, only for this unfortunate break that
is bound to keep me laid up for another month or
two. The doctor set my leg afresh, and tells me
that this time I will really get perfectly well, given
time. But it's hard to think that my cousin
Janice, his only child, will lose so great a sum
if some one fails to locate Uncle Felix, and get
his signature to a paper inside of another month."</p>

<p>"Why, how is that, father?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Circumstances have arisen that will throw a
fortune into her hands;" the stockman continued;
"but the time limit approaches, and if his signature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
is not forthcoming others will reap the benefit,
particularly that rascally cousin of mine,
Eugene Warringford. You remember meeting
him a year ago, Frank, when he came around asking
many questions, as though he might have
tracked his uncle out this way, and then lost the
trail?"</p>

<p>"Why not send us, dad?" demanded Frank,
standing up in front of the stockman, with a
smile of confidence on his face.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>THE LISTENER UNDER THE WINDOW</h3>
<br />

<p>"That was what I had in mind, Frank, when
I hurried Ted Conway out to find you both,"
Colonel Haywood remarked, his face filled with
pride and confidence.</p>

<p>"Will you let me see the note, please?"
asked Bob; who expected some day to study to be
a lawyer, his father's family having had several
Kentucky judges among their number.</p>

<p>Just as the owner of the ranch had said, the
communication was exceedingly brief, and to the
point, not an unnecessary word having been written.
It was in pencil, and the handwriting was
crabbed; just what one might expect of an elderly
man, given over heart and soul to scientific research.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know the writing well enough
to feel sure this came from your noted uncle,
sir?" asked Bob, as he turned the paper over.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Bob," replied the cattleman,
promptly. "There is not the least possibility of
it's being a practical joke. Nobody out here
knows anything about my uncle, who disappeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
so long ago. Yes, you can set it down as
positive that the letter is genuine enough. He's
located somewhere up in that most astonishing
hole, the greatest wonder, most people admit, in
the entire world. But just how you two boys are
ever going to find him is another question."</p>

<p>"We can try, dad; and that's all you could do
if you were able to tramp. It happens that the
Grand Canyon isn't more than a hundred and
thirty miles from our ranch here, and we can
ride that in a few days. How do you feel about
it, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Nothing would please me better," replied the
other boy, quickly, his face lighting up with delight
at the prospect of a long ride in the saddle,
to be followed by days, and perhaps weeks, of
roaming through that wonderland, where Nature
had outdone all her other works in trying to heap
up astonishing surprises.</p>

<p>"So far as I'm concerned," Frank went on,
"I've always wanted to visit the Grand Canyon,
and meant to do it some day later on. Of course
I've seen what the little Colorado has to show,
because it's only a long day's ride off. Mr.
Hinchman can, I reckon, give us some points
about the place, and maybe even mention several
smaller canyons where we might be likely to find
Uncle Felix in Echo Cave."</p>

<p>"Which I'll be only too happy to attempt,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
answered the gentleman from Mohave City;
"and as I said before, I know considerable about
the mysteries of the big hole in the desert, all of
which is at your service. Somehow, the queer
way that message in the floating bottle came to
me, excited my curiosity; and I'll be satisfied if
I can only have a hand in the finding of the noted
gentleman who, as your father has been telling
me, vanished in the midst of his fame."</p>

<p>"And now, dad, please explain just what we
are to do in case luck follows us in our hunt, and
we run across the professor," said Frank.</p>

<p>"You are to explain to him that the long option
which he held on that San Bernardino mine will
expire in one more month. The work had been
going on in a listless way for three years. All at
once some time back they struck a wonderfully
rich lode, and vein has been followed far enough
to show that it is bound to be a record breaker."</p>

<p>"That sounds great!" declared the deeply interested
Bob.</p>

<p>"The mine couldn't be bought for a million
to-day," continued the stockman; "and yet Uncle
Felix is probably carrying around with him (for
it couldn't be found at his home) a little legal
document whereby it will become his sole property
in case he chooses to plank down the modest sum
of twenty thousand dollars by the thirtieth of next
month!"</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>

<p>"Whew! that's going some, eh, Bob?" exclaimed
Frank, with a little whistle that accentuated
his surprise.</p>

<p>"Then if we are fortunate enough to find Uncle
Felix before that time has expired, what shall we
do, sir?" asked the precise Bob, who was always
keeping an eye out for the legal aspect of things.</p>

<p>"Coax him to accompany you to the nearest
notary public, where he can sign his acceptance of
the terms under which he holds the option on the
San Bernardino. But if this happens after the
thirtieth it is all wasted energy; for at midnight
of that day, I happen to know, the option expires,"
the ranchman continued, somewhat impressively.</p>

<p>Just as he finished speaking he suddenly turned
toward the window, at which his keen vision had
caught sight of a moving shadow, as though someone
might have been crouching without, and listening.</p>

<p>"Who is there at the window?" he called out,
sternly.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned that way. After several
seconds had passed a figure rose up, and a head
was thrust through the opening. It belonged to
a dark-faced cow-puncher, named Abajo, who was
supposed to be a half-breed Mexican. Although
never a favorite with the owner of the Circle
Ranch, Abajo was a first-class handler of the rope,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
and could ride a horse as well as anyone. He had
been employed by Colonel Haywood for half a
year. He talked "United States," as Frank was
used to saying, as well as the average cowman.
But Frank had never liked the fellow. There
seemed something crafty in his ways that was
foreign to the make-up of the boy.</p>

<p>"It's only me, boss," said Abajo, with an attempt
at a grin. "I wanted to ask you about that
job you set me on yesterday. I took Pete along,
and we found the lost bunch of stock in a valley
ten mile away from Thunder Mountain in the
Fox Canyon country. Got 'em all safe in but
seven. Never seen hair nor hide of them; but
after gettin' back it struck me there was one place
they might a strayed to that we didn't look up.
If so be you say the word I'll pick up Pete again,
and make another try."</p>

<p>"Why, of course you had better go, Abajo,"
remarked the stockman, looking keenly at the
other, for he did not like the way in which the
half-breed had been apparently loitering under
that open window, as though listening to all that
was passing in the room beyond. "I told you
not to draw rein till you'd found all the missing
stock; or knew what had become of them.
That's all, Abajo."</p>

<p>The Mexican cowboy hurried away. A minute
later and they heard him shouting to Pete; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
then the clatter of horses' hoofs told that the pair
were galloping wildly across the open.</p>

<p>"I wonder how much he heard?" said Frank;
from which it would appear that he also suspected
the other of having spied upon them for some purpose.</p>

<p>"Much good it could have done him, even if
he caught all we said," replied his father. "Because,
of course, he doesn't know anything about
Uncle Felix; and couldn't be interested in whether
he is living or dead."</p>

<p>"No," remarked Mr. Hinchman, "but the
mention of a mine going a-begging that is worth
a comfortable fortune, like a million or two,
would interest Abajo. I know his type pretty
well, and you can rest assured that they're always
on the lookout for easy money."</p>

<p>"But didn't it strike you, dad," ventured Frank,
"that his excuse for being under that window was
silly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, because Abajo has always been able to
understand, without asking what he should do under
such conditions. He wanted some excuse
for drawing near the open window, and he found
it. Perhaps he's heard something about the coming
of Mr. Hinchman here, and the queer finding
of the bottle that floated down the Colorado for
one or two hundred miles. I spoke to the foreman,
Bart Heminway, about it."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>

<p>"When would you want us to make a start?"
asked Bob, looking as though he might be ready
to jump into his saddle then and there.</p>

<p>"Oh! there is no such rushing hurry as all
that," replied the cattleman, laughing at the eagerness
of the two lads. "Your horses are a bit
off, just now, and after all that fight in the wolf
den you boys need a rest."</p>

<p>"But when do we start?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Suppose you get ready to move in the morning,"
Colonel Haywood replied, after reflecting a
moment. "That will give me time to write a
letter to Uncle Felix, so that you can deliver it,
if you're lucky enough to find his Echo Cave; and
at the same time you can make up your packs; for
you will need blankets, and plenty of grub
along."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon you're right, dad," admitted
Frank; "only it seems as if we might be losing
valuable time. All the same we're going to do
just what you say. Now, if you haven't anything
more to tell us, we'll just skip out, and begin looking
up some of the supplies for our campaign in
the Grand Canyon."</p>

<p>"Get along with you, then," laughed the ranchman.
"I want to ask Mr. Hinchman a few more
questions that have occurred to me since you came
home. And, boys, grub will be ready in a short
time, now, for there's Ah Sin stepping to the door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
every little while, to look around and see if the
boys are in sight. You know what that sign
means."</p>

<p>Frank and his chum went off, to make out a
list of things they would take along with them on
the strange expedition upon which they were about
to start on the following morning.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that slippery customer,
Abajo?" Bob asked his chum, as the afternoon
waned, and they were sitting on the long porch
of the ranch house.</p>

<p>"I've never liked him ever since he came here;
but dad was in need of help, and the half-breed
certainly knows his business to a dot," replied
Frank, who was examining the new girth his chum
had attached to his saddle, mentally deciding that
whatever the young Kentuckian attempted, he did
neatly and well.</p>

<p>"Didn't I hear something about his being a
relative to that Spanish Joe who gave us so much
trouble a little while back, on Thunder Mountain?"
Bob continued.</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't say for sure, but some say
he is a nephew," Frank answered. "Both of
them have Mexican blood in their veins; and,
when you come to think of it, there is some resemblance
in their faces."</p>

<p>"But do you really think Abajo was listening?"
the other asked.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>

<p>"It looked like it; that's as far as I've got,"
laughed Frank.</p>

<p>"But," Bob protested, "even if he knew that
there was a big fortune connected with the paper
this queer old professor carries on his person,
what good would that do Abajo?"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged his broad shoulders as he replied:</p>

<p>"Well, you never can tell what crazy notions
some of these schemers after a fortune will hatch
up. He might make up his mind to start a little
hunt for the hermit of Echo Cave on his own
hook; with the idea of getting a transfer of that
valuable paper."</p>

<p>"That's a fact!" declared Bob, looking interested.
"Perhaps, after all, we won't have our
work cut out for us as easy as we thought."</p>

<p>"Small difference that will make," Frank went
on, with a shutting of his teeth that told of the
spirit animating the boy when difficulties hove in
sight.</p>

<p>"I agree with you, all right, Frank," his companion
remarked. "And perhaps it'll only make
the hunt all the more interesting if we believe
we've got opposition. You know how it was when
Peg Grant threw his hat in the ring, and tried
to find out what made those queer sounds in the
heart of Thunder Mountain?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do," came the quick reply. "It
stirred us up to doing bigger stunts than if we'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
thought we had it all our own way. Nothing
like competition to get the best out of any fellow."</p>

<p>"Correct you are, Frank. But speaking of
Abajo, perhaps that's him coming back now," and
as he spoke the Kentucky boy pointed across to
a point where a single rider could be seen heading
for the ranch house.</p>

<p>He was still far away, but the eyes of Frank
Haywood were very keen. Besides, he knew the
"style" of every cowboy who was in the employ
of his father, and was able to pick them out almost
as far as he could see them.</p>

<p>"You're away off there, Bob," he remarked
quietly.</p>

<p>"Then it isn't the half-breed?" asked his
chum.</p>

<p>"I know the way that chap sits in the saddle,"
came the reply. "Only one man on the pay roll
of Circle Ranch holds himself that way. It's
Pete."</p>

<p>"Pete Rawlings, the fellow who went with
Abajo to round up the missing cattle?" asked
Bob.</p>

<p>"He's the one," Frank went on. "And from
the fact that he rides alone, I take it he's bringing
news."</p>

<p>"Of the seven head of cattle that have disappeared,
you mean, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. They may have found them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
Abajo is standing by, while Pete comes in to
make some sort of report. There's that rustler
bunch that comes from the other side of the Gila
river once in a while, under Pedro Mendoza, you
remember. But he'll soon be on deck, and then
we'll know. Come along, Bob, and we'll let dad
hear that Pete is sighted. He'll be interested
some, I reckon."</p>

<p>A short time later the single rider threw himself
from his saddle after the usual impetuous
manner of cowboys in general.</p>

<p>"Back again, Pete; and did you see anything
of that seven head?" asked Colonel Haywood,
who had come outside.</p>

<p>"Ain't run across hair nor hide of 'em, Colonel,"
replied the squatty cattleman, as he "waddled"
up to the spot where the little group awaited
his coming; for like many of his kind, Pete was decidedly
bow-legged, possibly from riding a horse
all his life; and his walk somewhat resembled that
of a sailor ashore after a long cruise.</p>

<p>"Where did you leave Abajo?" asked Frank,
unable to restrain his curiosity.</p>

<p>"Didn't leave him," replied the other, with a
grin. "He gave me the merry ha! ha! and said
as how he reckoned he'd had enough of the old
Circle. Got his month's pay yesterday, you see,
an' he's even. I reckoned somethin' was in the
wind when I seen him talkin' with that feller."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>

<p>"Who was that, Pete?" questioned Colonel
Haywood; and the prompt answer made Frank
and Bob exchange significant looks, for it seemed
to voice their worst fears.</p>

<p>"A gent as you had avisitin' here some time
back, Colonel. Reckon as how he don't feel any
too warm toward you, accordin' to the way he
used to bring them black brows of his'n down,
when he thought you wa'n't lookin'. And his
name was Eugene Warringford."<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>

<h3>STARTING FOR THE GRAND CANYON</h3>
<br />

<p>No one appeared to be greatly surprised at
this piece of news. Apparently it had been already
discounted in the mind of Frank, his father,
and even Bob Archer.</p>

<p>"So, that's the way the wind sets, is it?" remarked
the colonel, frowning.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, dad, that proves one thing," declared
Frank.</p>

<p>"Meaning about that business of listening under
the window?" observed the owner of Circle
Ranch. "It certainly does. Abajo has been in
the employ of Eugene Warringford from the
start. But there must have been some other good
reason why that schemer wanted to find Uncle
Felix. He suspected that, sooner or later, the
old gentleman would communicate with me, because
I used to be quite a favorite of his, years
ago."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he sent the half-breed here to get
employment from you just to spy around," declared
Frank. "All the time he was accepting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
your money, he had a regular income from Eugene."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, he earned all he got here," said the
ranchman, quickly. "Say what I may about
Abajo, he had no superior when it came to throwing
the rope, and rounding up a herd. Those
Mexicans make the finest of cowboys. They are
at home in the saddle, every time."</p>

<p>"Also in hanging around under windows, and
listening to what is said," added Frank. "As for
me, I have little use for their breed. And, dad,
if ever you give me the reins here, no Mexican
will ever get a job on old Circle Ranch."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked the stockman, laughing at
the vigor with which his son and heir made this
assertion, "perhaps I'm leaning that way myself.
After all, there's nothing like your own kind. We
don't understand these fellows. Their ways are
not the same as ours; and I reckon we puncture
their pride often enough. But there's no trouble
now about understanding why Abajo gave us the
go-by to-day."</p>

<p>"Huh! he had some news worth while carrying
to his boss," said Frank. "And I can just imagine
how Eugene's little eyes will sparkle when
he hears about that valuable paper; eh, dad?"</p>

<p>"You're right, son," the ranchman replied.
"Because, it stands to reason he couldn't know
anything about it before. The mine was a dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
one up to a few months back, when that lucky-find
lode was struck by accident. Eugene will put up
a big chase to find this Echo Cave, now that he
knows Uncle Felix is located somewhere in the
Grand Canyon of the Colorado."</p>

<p>"But it won't make a bit of difference in our
plans, dad; will it?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"That depends on you two boys. If you think
you can carry the game along, even with Eugene
against you, I see no reason to make any change,"
the stockman replied, with a look that spoke of
much confidence.</p>

<p>The balance of the afternoon was spent in exchanging
views, and much study of the map of
the famous canyon of the Colorado, which it happened
the ranch owner had in his desk.</p>

<p>All sorts of theories were advanced by first
one and then another of the group. It happened
that Colonel Haywood himself had never as yet
paid a visit to the strange gash in the soil of
northwestern Arizona; and he admitted the fact
with a rueful face.</p>

<p>"Then just as soon as you get well, dad, make
up your mind you're going to take a little vacation,
and see the Grand Canyon," said Frank.
"When we come back, perhaps what we have to
say will set you wild to go. And we expect to
bring news of old Uncle Felix too, if he's still in
the land of the living."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>

<p>"Let's go over that ground again," remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>"Now you're referring to what was said about
the funny old stone dwellings of the cliff dwellers,
who used to live there centuries ago," remarked
Frank.</p>

<p>"And he's right, too," declared the ranchman.
"I get the point Bob makes. It was about these
wonderful people that Uncle Felix was so deeply
interested, and he made up his mind to shut himself
away from all the world, just to study up
their history, as left in the holes in the rock."</p>

<p>"And it would seem to follow, then," said
Bob, readily, "that he will be found located in
one of those series of terraces where these holes
are discovered. I notice that there are a number
of these villages connected with the map of
the Grand Canyon; but the chances are your Uncle
Felix wouldn't take up with any where tourist
travel was common."</p>

<p>"Now, that sounds all right," admitted Frank.
"In the first place he would have been heard
from long ago, if tourists ran across him; because
they always talk, and send their accounts to be
published in the papers."</p>

<p>"Besides, these scientific men hate to be
watched when they're wrapped up in work like
this. I've known a couple back in Old Kentucky,"
Bob went on.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>

<p>"According to your idea, then," said the Colonel,
nodding approvingly, "this Echo Cave he
mentions will prove to be some new place that the
ordinary tourist in the big canyon has never set
eyes on?"</p>

<p>"That's my opinion, sir," replied Bob.</p>

<p>"And if that's so, then it wouldn't pay you
boys to waste any time looking into these ruins
of the homes of the cliff dwellers located around
Grand View; and in Walnut Canyon, some nine
miles from Flagstaff," the ranchman continued.</p>

<p>"I think we'd save more or less time that way,
sir," Bob declared.</p>

<p>"And you still want to go on horseback; when
you might reach the railroad, and take a train,
easily enough?" asked Colonel Haywood.</p>

<p>The boys exchanged glances. They were
wedded to the saddle, and disliked the idea of
leaving their favorite steeds behind them when
embarking on this new venture.</p>

<p>"We've picked out the trail we expect to follow,
dad," Frank said, pleadingly; "and it seems
to run pretty smooth, with only a few mountains
to cross, and a couple of rivers to ford. If you
don't object seriously, Bob and I would prefer
to go mounted."</p>

<p>"Oh! as far as that goes, I don't blame you,
boys," the stockman hastened to say in reply; for
he could understand the yearning one feels for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
a favorite horse; and how a seat in the saddle
seems to be the finest thing in the world.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dad!" exclaimed Frank. "I
reckoned that you'd talk that way. Somehow or
other I just don't feel more'n half myself out of
the saddle. And when we start to go down into
the canyon we can find some place to leave our
mounts where they'll be 'tended decently enough."</p>

<p>Ah Sin, the Chinese cook of the ranch, who
generally accompanied the boys when the whole
outfit went on the grand round-up, with the mess
wagon in attendance, now came outdoors, and
beat his gong to announce dinner.</p>

<p>The cowboys were not far away, awaiting the
summons with the customary range appetites held
in check; and when they were seated at the table
they presented a merry crowd. Frank's mother
happened to be visiting East at this time. He
had a maiden aunt, however, who looked after the
household duties, and sat at the end of the long
table to pour the coffee.</p>

<p>Of course there was more or less talk about the
sudden flitting of the half-breed, Abajo. Nobody
had any regrets, for he had never been liked.
And there were several who secretly felt pleased,
because they had happened to quarrel with the
dark-skinned Mexican at different times, and did
not altogether fancy the way he had of scowling,
while his finger felt the edge of the knife he carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
in his gay sash, after the manner of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Colonel Haywood did not see fit to explain the
real cause for the going of Abajo, except to his
foreman, Bart Heminway. But during the evening,
when Frank and Bob were making up their
packs so as to get an early start in the morning,
the ranch owner might have been seen in earnest
consultation with the foreman.</p>

<p>Presently Bart went out, to return with Old
Hank Coombs, and another cowman known as
Chesty Lane; who had of course received this
name on account of the way he thrust out his
figure, rather than from any inclination on his
part to boast of his wonderful deeds.</p>

<p>"Chesty tells me, Colonel," said Bart, "that he
used to be a guide in this same Grand Canyon,
years ago. I never knowed it 'till right to-day.
And if so be you intend to send Old Hank up thar
to keep tabs on the doings of that ugly pair, Abajo
and Warringford, thar couldn't be a better man
to pick out than Chesty. You can depend on him
every time."</p>

<p>Then followed another conference, of which
the two boys, wrapped up in their own plans in another
room, were of course entirely ignorant.</p>

<p>It was decided, however, that the two cowmen
should wait until the boys were well on their way.
Then, supplied with ample funds, they could ride<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
to the nearest station, meet the first train bound
north, and be at Flagstaff before night came
around.</p>

<p>In this way the Colonel figured that he was safeguarding
the interests of Bob and Frank. Already
had he begun to regret allowing them to
go, and if it had not been for the high regard he
had for his word, once given, he might have
backed down. However, perhaps the sending of
Hank and his companion might answer the purpose,
and prove a valuable move.</p>

<p>The night passed, and with early dawn there
was a stir all about Circle Ranch.</p>

<p>Every cowboy on the place accompanied Frank
and Bob several miles on their long journey, every
fellow wishing he had been asked to join them for
the adventure. And when Bart Hemingway gave
the word to turn back, the entire group waved
their hats, and cheered as long as the two lads

<h3>BUCKSKIN ON GUARD</h3>
<br />

<p>"A good day's ride, all right, Bob!"</p>

<p>"You never said truer words, Frank. And
now, with night setting in, how far do you think
we've covered since the start this morning?"</p>

<p>The Kentucky boy sat in his saddle with a slight
show of weariness, which was not to be wondered
at, considering the steadiness with which they had
kept on the move, hour after hour, heading in a
general Westerly direction.</p>

<p>The satin skin of Domino was flecked with
foam. Even the tough little Buckskin mount of
Frank showed signs of weariness; though ready
to keep on if his master gave the word.</p>

<p>"That would be hard to tell," replied the
rancher's son; "but it must be all of sixty-five
miles, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Then that beats my record some," declared
the other.</p>

<p>"But it was a glorious gallop all the way
through," asserted Frank.</p>

<p>"That's what; and more to follow to-morrow,"
his chum hastened to remark.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>

<p>"But a different kind of travel, the chances
are, Bob. To-day it happened that we were
crossing the great mesa, and it was like a floor
for being level. Over yonder, ahead, you can see
the mountains we must cross. Then there are
rivers to ford or swim. Yes, variety is the spice
of life; and unless I miss my guess we're due for
a big change to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Think we can make Flagstaff by to-morrow
night?" asked the Kentucky lad, who, at a time
like this, seemed to depend very much upon the
superior knowledge of his chum, who had been
brought up on the plains.</p>

<p>"We're going to make a try; that's as far as
I've got," laughed Frank. "But what about
camping here?"</p>

<p>"As good as anywhere," answered Bob.
"Fact is, I'm admitting to being ready to drop
down in any old place, so long as I can stretch my
legs, and roll. No wonder a horse likes to turn
over as soon as you take the saddle off. Shall
we call it a go, Frank?"</p>

<p>The other jumped to the ground. Bob thought
he heard him give a little grunt in doing so; but
just then he was interested in repressing his own
feelings.</p>

<p>However, when they had moved about somewhat,
both boys confessed to feeling considerably
better. As for the horses, there was no danger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
of their straying after that gallop of many hours
in the hot sun. They took their roll, and then
began hunting for stray tufts of grass among the
buffalo berry bushes.</p>

<p>The sun had already set, and twilight told of
the coming night. Around them lay the mesa,
with the mountains cropping up like a crust along
the edge. It was a familiar scene, to Frank in
particular, and one of which he never tired.</p>

<p>"I noticed some jack rabbits as we came
along," remarked Bob, "and as they always come
out of their burrows about dusk to play, suppose
I try and knock over a couple right now."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't object myself to a good dinner of
rabbit, after that ride," Frank admitted, as he
proceeded to get the little tent in position, a task
that was only a pleasure to a boy fond of all outdoors.</p>

<p>So Bob immediately sauntered off toward the
spot where he had noticed the long-eared animals,
calculated to make a good meal for hungry campers.</p>

<p>"I heard gophers whistling," called out Frank,
"and that means there's a village somewhere close
by. Keep your eyes out for the rattlers; they are
always found where prairie dogs live."</p>

<p>"I never forget that, Frank," came back from
the disappearing hunter.</p>

<p>Frank went on with his preparations. A fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
would be necessary, if they expected to cook fresh
meat; and it is not always an easy thing to have
such when out on the open plain or mesa. But
Frank had already sighted a supply of fuel sufficient
for their needs and it was indeed next
door to a miracle to find the dead branch of a
pine tree here, far away from the mountains,
where the nearest trees seemed to grow.</p>

<p>"I reckon it was just lifted up in some little
tornado, and carried through the air, just to land
where we needed it," he remarked, as he dragged
the log closer to where he had quickly put up the
tent; and then began chopping at it with his little
camp hatchet.</p>

<p>As he worked there came a quick report from
a point not far away.</p>

<p>"That means one jack," he remarked, raising
his head to listen; but to his surprise no second
shot followed.</p>

<p>"Well, if he hopes to get a pair, he'll have to
hurry up his cakes," Frank went on; "because the
night's settling down on us fast. But then one
will give us a taste all around, and help out."</p>

<p>It was some little time before he heard Bob
coming, and then the Kentuckian seemed to be
walking rather unsteadily. Frank jumped to his
feet, with the suspicion that possibly after all Bob
had met with a misfortune. In the minute of
time that he was waiting for his chum to appear,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
a number of things flashed through his head to
give him uneasiness.</p>

<p>Had Bob been unlucky enough to run across one
of those aggressive little prairie rattlesnakes after
all? Could he have wounded himself in any way
when he fired his repeating rifle? Neither of
these might prove to be the case; and yet Bob was
certainly staggering as he came along.</p>

<p>Now he could be seen by the light of the little
fire. Frank stared, for his chum was certainly
bending over, as though bearing a load. He had
heard no outcry that would signify the presence
of others in the neighborhood. Ah! surely those
were the long slender legs of an antelope which
Bob gripped in front of him.</p>

<p>"Bully for you!" exclaimed Frank. "Where
under the sun did you run across that fine game?
Say, you sure take the cake, stepping out just to
knock over a couple of long-ears; and then coming
back ten minutes later with a fine antelope on
your back. How did you do it, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," laughed the other. "Happened
to start up against the wind, and was creeping
up behind some buffalo berry bushes to see
if there were any jack rabbits beyond, when this
little fellow jumped to his feet. Why he didn't
light out when we came along, I never could tell
you."</p>

<p>"Oh! he just knew we wanted a good supper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
I reckon," Frank remarked. "And now to get
busy."</p>

<p>It did not take them long to cut some choice
bits from the antelope, which they began to cook
at the fire, thrusting the meat through with long
splinters of wood, which in turn were held in a
slanting position in the ground. When one part
gave evidence of being browned the novel spit
was turned until all sides had been equally served.</p>

<p>"Remember the way Old Hank showed us
how to toll antelope for a shot, when you can't
find cover to get near enough?" asked Frank, as
they sat there, disposing of their supper, with the
satisfaction hunger always brings in its train.</p>

<p>"You mean with the red handkerchief waved
over the top of a bush?" Bob went on. "Hank
said there never was a more curious little beast
than an antelope. If he didn't have a red rag a
white one would do. Once he said he just lay
down on his back and kicked his heels in the air.
The game ran away, but came back; and each time
just a little bit closer, till Hank could fire, and get
his supper. I've done something the same for
ducks, in a marsh back home, trying to draw their
attention to the decoys I had out."</p>

<p>A small stream ran near by, at which the boys
and horses had quenched their thirst. Sometimes
its gentle murmur floated to their ears as they sat
there, chatting, and wondering whether their mission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
to the Grand Canyon was destined to bear
fruit or not.</p>

<p>"I can get the smell of some late wild roses,"
remarked Frank. "And it isn't often that you
find such things up on one of these high mesas, or
table lands. Do you know, I rather imagine this
used to be a favorite stamping ground for buffalo
in those good old days when herds of tens of thousands
could be met with, rolling like the waves of
a sea over the plains."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" asked Bob, always
seeking information.</p>

<p>"The grass, for one thing," came the reply.
"Then I noticed quite a few old sun-burned remnants
of skulls as we came along. The bone
hunter didn't gather his crop in this region, that
means. Besides, didn't you see all those queer
little indentations that looked as though they
might have been pools away back years ago?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I did; and wondered whatever could
have made them," Bob admitted.</p>

<p>"I may be wrong," Frank continued; "but
somehow I've got an idea that those must be what
they used to call buffalo wallows. Anyhow, that
doesn't matter to us. We've made a good day
of it; found a jim-dandy place for a camp; got
some juicy fresh meat; and to-morrow we hope to
land in Flagstaff."</p>

<p>"And what then?" queried Bob.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>

<p>"We'll decide that while we ride along to-morrow,"
Frank answered. "Perhaps it may
seem better that we leave our horses there, and
take the train for the Grand Canyon; though I'm
inclined to make another day of it, and follow the
old wagon trail over the mesa, and through the
pine forest past Red Butte, to Grand View."</p>

<p>"Listen to Buckskin snorting; what d'ye suppose
ails him?" asked Bob, as his chum stopped
speaking.</p>

<p>"I was just going to say that myself," remarked
Frank, putting out his hand for his rifle;
and at the same time scattering the brands of the
dying fire so that darkness quickly fell upon the
spot.</p>

<p>"Too late, I'm afraid," muttered Bob.</p>

<p>"Seems like it, because the horses are sure
coming straight for us," said Frank; "but there
are many people moving around in this section,
and perhaps some tenderfeet from the East have
lost themselves, and would be glad of a chance to
sit by our blaze and taste antelope meat, fresh
where it is grown. Step back, Bob, and let's wait
to see what turns up!"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>

<h3>STANDING BY THE LAW</h3>
<br />

<p>"What had we ought to do?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"They must have seen our fire, and that's what
made them head this way. So, all we can do is
to wait, and see what they want," replied Frank.</p>

<p>"But there don't seem to be many in the
party," his chum went on.</p>

<p>"I think not more than two, Bob."</p>

<p>"You can tell from the beat of their horses'
hoofs&mdash;is that it?" inquired the boy who wanted
to learn.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's easy enough, Bob."</p>

<p>By this time the sounds had grown quite loud,
and both boys strained their eyes, trying to locate
the approaching horsemen. In the old days on
the plains every stranger was deemed an enemy
until he had proven himself a friend. Nowadays
it is hardly so positive as that; but nevertheless
those who are wise take no chances.</p>

<p>"I see them!" Bob announced; but although
the other saddle boy had not said so, he had picked
up the advancing figures several seconds before.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>

<p>"One thing sure," remarked Frank, as though
relieved, "I reckon they can't be horse thieves
or cattle rustlers."</p>

<p>"You mean they wouldn't be so bold about
coming forward?" ventured Bob.</p>

<p>"That's about the size of it; but we'll soon
know," Frank went on.</p>

<p>As the strangers drew rapidly nearer he began
to make out their "style" for the night was not
intensely dark. And somehow Frank's curiosity
increased in bounds. He discovered no signs of
the customary cowboy outfit about them. They
wore garments that savored of civilization, and
sat their horses with the air of men accustomed
to much riding.</p>

<p>"Hold hard there, strangers; or you'll be riding
us down!" Frank sang out, as the newcomers
loomed up close at hand.</p>

<p>At that the others drew rein, and brought their
horses to a halt. Bending low in the saddle they
seemed to be peering at the dimly-seen figures of
the two boys.</p>

<p>"Who is it&mdash;speak quick!" one of the
strangers said; and Frank believed he heard a
suspicious click accompanying the thrilling words.</p>

<p>"Two boys bound for Flagstaff and the Grand
Canyon," he answered, not wishing to take any
unnecessary chances.</p>

<p>"Where from, and what's your names?" continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
the other, in his commanding voice, that
somehow told Frank he must be one accustomed
to demanding obedience.</p>

<p>The ranch boy no longer felt any uneasiness.
He believed that these men were not to be feared.</p>

<p>"I am the son of Colonel Haywood, owner
of the Circle Ranch; and this is my chum, Bob
Archer, a Kentucky boy," he said, boldly.</p>

<p>Then the other man, who as yet had not spoken,
took occasion to remark:</p>

<p>"'Taint them, after all, Stanwix! Perhaps
we've been following the wrong trail."</p>

<p>The name gave Frank an idea. He had heard
more or less about the doings of a sheriff in a
neighboring county, called Yavapai, and his name
was the same as that mentioned by the second
dimly seen rider.</p>

<p>"Are you gentlemen from Prescott?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"That's where I hold out when I'm home,"
replied the one who had asked about their identity.</p>

<p>"Are you Sheriff Stanwix?" pursued the boy,
while his companion almost held his breath in
suspense.</p>

<p>"I am; and this is Hand, who holds the same
office in this county of Coconino," replied the
other, as he threw a leg over his saddle as though
about to dismount.</p>

<p>Both of them joined the boys, leaving their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
horses to stand with the bridles thrown over their
heads, cowboy fashion.</p>

<p>Frank meanwhile had picked up some small
fuel, and thrown it on the still smouldering fire.
It immediately started up into a blaze that continued
to increase.</p>

<p>They could now see that their visitors were two
keen-eyed men. The evidence of their calling
lay in the stars that decorated their left breasts.
Both looked as though they could hold their own
against odds. And of course they were armed as
became their dangerous profession.</p>

<p>Bob was especially interested. He had never
really had anything to do with an officer of the
law; and surveyed the pair with all the ardor
of boyish curiosity.</p>

<p>To see one sheriff was a treat; but to have two
drop down upon them after this fashion must
be an event worth remembering.</p>

<p>"We had the good luck to knock over a young
antelope just before dark," Frank remarked, after
each of the men had insisted in gravely shaking
hands with both himself and Bob. "Perhaps you
haven't had any supper, and wouldn't mind taking
pot luck with us?"</p>

<p>"How about that, Hand?" questioned the taller
man, turning with a laugh to the second sheriff.</p>

<p>"Just suits me," came the reply, as the speaker
threw himself down on the hard ground. "Half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
an hour's rest will do the hosses some good, too."</p>

<p>"Thank you, boys, we accept, and with pleasure,"
Mr. Stanwix went on, turning again toward
Frank.</p>

<p>Bob immediately got busy, and started to cut
further bits from the carcase of his small antelope.
There would be plenty for even the
healthy appetites of the two officers, and then
leave enough for the boys' breakfast.</p>

<p>"We're in something of a hurry to get on to
Flagstaff ourselves, boys," the Yavapai sheriff
remarked, as he sniffed the cooking venison with
relish; "but the temptation to hold over a bit is
too strong. You see, Hand and myself have just
made up our minds to bag our birds this trip, no
matter where it takes us, or how long we're on the
job."</p>

<p>"Then you're after some cattle rustlers or bad
men, I reckon," Frank remarked.</p>

<p>"A couple of the worst scoundrels ever known
around these diggings," replied the officer.
"They've been jumping from one county into another,
when pushed; and in the end Hand, here,
and myself concluded we'd just join our forces.
We've got a posse to the south, and another working
to the north; but we happened to strike the
trail of our birds just before dusk, and we've been
following it in hopes of reaching Flagstaff before
they can get down into the gash, and hide."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>

<p>"A trail, you say?" Frank observed. "Could
it have been the one I've been following just out
of curiosity, and because it seemed to run in the
very direction my chum and myself were bound?"</p>

<p>"That's just what it was, Frank," the sheriff
answered, as he accepted the hot piece of browned
venison, stick and all, which Bob was holding out.
"We saw that there had come into the trail the
marks of two new hosses; and naturally enough
we got the idea that it might mean our men were
being followed by a couple of their own kind."</p>

<p>"Then when you saw our little fire, you thought
we were the kind of steers you wanted to round
up?" the boy asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! well," Mr. Stanwix replied with a little
chuckle; "we kept a touch on our irons when I
was asking you who you were; and if the reply
hadn't been all that it was, I reckon we'd have
politely asked you to throw up your hands, boys.
But say, this meat is prime, and seems to go to
the spot."</p>

<p>"I don't know which spot you mean, Stanwix,"
remarked the other officer, who was also munching
away like a half-starved man; "but mine suits
me all right. I'm right glad we stopped. The
rest will tone the nags up for a long pull; and as
for me, I'll be in great shape after this feed."</p>

<p>Bob was kept busy cooking more and more, for
the two men seemed to realize, after once getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
a taste, that they were desperately hungry. But
he did it with pleasure. There was something
genial about the manner of Mr. Stanwix that quite
captured the heart of the Kentucky lad. He
knew the tall man could be as gentle as a woman,
if the occasion ever arose when he had a wounded
comrade to nurse; and if his reputation did
not speak wrongly his courage was decidedly
great.</p>

<p>While they sat there the two men talked of
various subjects. Frank was curious to know
something about those whom they were now
banded together in a determined effort to capture,
and so Mr. Stanwix told a few outlines of the
case.</p>

<p>The men were known as the Arizona Kid and
Big Bill Guffey. They had been cattlemen,
miners, and about every other thing known to the
Southwest. By degrees they had acquired the
reputation of being bad men; and all sorts of lawless
doings were laid at their door. And finally
it came to defying the sheriff, evading capture by
flitting to another county, and playing a game of
hide-and-seek, until their bold methods were the
talk of the whole country.</p>

<p>Then it was the Coconino sheriff had conceived
the idea of an alliance with his brother officer in
the adjoining county, of which the thriving city
of Prescott was the seat of government.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>

<p>Frank even had Mr. Stanwix describe the two
men whom the officers were pursuing.</p>

<p>"We expect to be around the Grand Canyon
for some weeks," the lad remarked; "and it might
be we'd run across these chaps. To know who
they were, would be putting us on our guard, and
besides, perhaps we might be able to get notice to
you, sir."</p>

<p>"That sounds all right, Frank," the other had
hastened to reply; "and believe me, I appreciate
your friendly feelings. It's the duty of all good
citizens to back up the man they've put in office,
when he's trying to free the community of a bad
crowd."</p>

<p>Then he explained just how they might get
word to him in case they had anything of importance
to communicate. Although the Tarapai
sheriff knew nothing about wireless telegraphy, he
did understand some of the methods which savage
tribes in many countries use in order to send news
hundreds of miles; sometimes by a chain of drums
stationed on the hill tops miles apart; or it may be
by the waving of a red flag.</p>

<p>"And I want to tell you, Frank," Mr. Stanwix
concluded, "if so be you ever do have occasion to
send me that message, just make up your minds
that I'll come to you on the jump, with Hand at
my heels. But for your own sakes I hope you
won't run across these two hard cases. We've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
got an idea that they mean to do some hold-up
game in the Grand Canyon, where hundreds of
rich travelers gather. And if luck favors us we
expect to put a spoke in their wheel before they
run far!"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>

<h3>THE MOQUI WHO WAS CAUGHT NAPPING</h3>
<br />

<p>Sheriff Stanwix arose with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Reckon we'd better be moving on, Hand,"
he said, evidently with reluctance; for it was very
pleasant sitting there, taking his ease beside the
camp fire of the two boys; but when duty called
this man never let anything stand in the way.</p>

<p>Their horses had not strayed far away. Like
most animals they had sought the company of
their kind, as various sounds indicated, Buckskin
doubtless showing his prairie strain by sundry nips
with his teeth at the strangers.</p>

<p>Another shake of hands all around; then the
sheriffs threw themselves into their saddles, and
were off. The last the two lads saw of them was
when their figures were swallowed up in the night-mists;
and then it was a friendly wave of the arm
that told how much they had appreciated the hospitality
of the saddle boys.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, it doesn't seem quite so lonely
out here, after all," said Frank, laughing, as he
and his chum settled down again.</p>

<p>"Why, no," added Bob, "I thought we owned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
the whole coop; but I take it back. There are
others abroad, it seems."</p>

<p>"I only hope those two fly-by-night birds don't
take a notion to double on their trail, and come
back to pay us a visit," Frank remarked; and of
course Bob understood that he meant the bad men
who were being rounded up by Sheriff Stanwix,
aided by the official of Coconino County.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'd better douse the glim, then?"
Bob suggested.</p>

<p>"Let it burn out," Frank remarked; "I don't
believe there's much chance of anybody else seeing
it now; because it's pretty low. Our tent
shows up about as plain, come to think of it; but
I don't mean to do without shelter."</p>

<p>They sat there, chatting on various subjects, for
some time. Of course their mission to the region
of the greatest natural wonder in the world took
a leading part in this conversation. But then
they also spoke of their recent visitors; and as
Bob showed signs of considerable interest, Frank
told all he had ever heard about the valor of the
Prescott sheriff.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you feel about it, Bob,"
he said, at length, with a yawn, "but I'm getting
mighty sleepy."</p>

<p>"Same here; and I move we turn in," Bob immediately
replied.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as the idea had received unanimous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
approval, they took a look at the horses, now
staked out with the ropes, and, finding them comfortable,
both boys crawled under the canvas.</p>

<p>Some hours later they were aroused suddenly
by a shrill yell. As they sat up, and groped for
their rifles, not realizing what manner of peril
could be hanging over them, the loud snorting
of the horses came to their ears.</p>

<p>"Come on!" exclaimed Frank, in considerable
excitement. "Sounds like somebody might be
bothering our mounts!"</p>

<p>Bob had not been so very long in the Western
country; but he knew what that meant all right.
Horses were supposed to be the most valuable
possessions among men who spent their lives on
the great plains and deserts of this region. In
the old days it was deemed a capital crime to steal
horses.</p>

<p>So Bob, shivering with excitement, but not fear,
hastened to follow at the heels of his chum, as
Frank hastily crawled out of the tent.</p>

<p>A rather battered looking moon was part way
up in the Eastern heavens. Though the light she
gave was none of the best, still, to the boys, coming
from the interior of the tent, it seemed quite
enough to enable them to see their way about,
and even distinguish objects at a little distance.</p>

<p>Frank lost no time heading in the direction
where he knew the horses had been staked out.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>

<p>"Anyhow, they don't seem to have got them
yet," remarked Bob, gleefully, as the sound of
prancing and snorting came to their ears louder
than ever.</p>

<p>Frank stopped for a couple of seconds to listen.</p>

<p>"Buckskin is carrying on something fierce," he
muttered. "He seems to be furiously mad, too.
Perhaps, after all, it may be a bear sniffing
around; though I'd never expect to find such a
thing out here, so far away from the
mountains."</p>

<p>He again started on, with Bob close at his elbow.
The words of his chum had given the Kentucky
lad new cause for other thrills. What if it
should prove to be a grizzly bear? He had had
one experience with such a monster, and was not
particularly anxious for another, not being in the
big game class.</p>

<p>Now they were approaching the spot where the
two roped horses were jumping restlessly about,
making queer sounds that could only indicate
alarm.</p>

<p>Frank spoke to his animal immediately, thinking
to reassure him.</p>

<p>"Easy now, Buckskin; what's making you act
this way? I don't see any enemy. If you've
given a false alarm, it'll sure be for the first
time!"</p>

<p>"Frank!" ventured the other lad, just then.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>

<p>"What is it, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a low groan!" continued
the Kentucky boy, in awed tones.</p>

<p>"You did?" ejaculated Frank, quickly.
"Have you any idea where it came from?"</p>

<p>As if to make it quite unnecessary for Bob to
reply, there came just then a low but distinct grunt
or groan. Frank could not tell which.</p>

<p>"Over this way, Frank; he's in this direction!"
exclaimed the impulsive Bob, as he started
to move off.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said the practical and cautious
Frank. "You never know what sort of
game you're up against, around here. Some of
these horse thieves can toll a fellow away from
his camp to beat the band, while a mate gets off
with the saddle band. I've been warned against
that very sort of play. Go slow, Bob, and keep
a finger on your trigger, I tell you."</p>

<p>They advanced slowly, looking all around in
the dim moonlight. Twice more the strange
sounds arose. Frank jumped to the conclusion
that it was, after all, no attempt to draw them
farther and farther away from the tent; because
the groans seemed to come from the one spot, instead
of gradually moving off in a tempting manner.</p>

<p>"Here he is, Bob!" he said, presently; and
the other, looking, saw a huddled-up figure lying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
upon the ground in the midst of the low buffalo
berry bushes.</p>

<p>Immediately they were bending over the form,
which had moved at their approach.</p>

<p>"Why, it's an Indian, Frank!" cried Bob, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, and unless I miss my guess, a Moqui
Indian at that," Frank replied. "Three of them
wandered down our way once, and gave us some
interesting exhibitions of their customs. You
know their home is up to the north. They are
said to be the descendants of the old cliff dwellers
who made all those holes high up in the rocks, to
keep out of the reach of enemies."</p>

<p>He was bending down over the other even
while saying this; and feeling to see if the Indian
could have been wounded in any way.</p>

<p>"What seems to be the matter with him,
Frank?" asked Bob, when this thing had been
going on for a full minute, the stricken man
grunting, and Frank appearing to continue his investigations.</p>

<p>"I tell you what," Frank remarked, presently;
"I honestly believe he's been kicked by the heels
of my sassy little Buckskin; perhaps he's badly
hurt; and then again, he may only have had the
wind knocked out of him. That horse is as bad
as any mule you ever saw, when it comes to planting
his heels."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>

<p>"But what was he prowling around the camp
for?" asked Bob, who had a hazy idea concerning
the red men of the West, gained perhaps
from early reading of the attacks on the wagon
trains of the pioneers of the prairie.</p>

<p>"Oh! these Moqui Indians wouldn't do a white
man any harm, unless they happened to take too
much juice of the agave plant, in the shape of
mescal," Frank hastened to say; "and I don't
seem to get the smell of that stuff. So the
chances are that he had something of an eye to
our horses."</p>

<p>"And as he didn't know about Buckskin's ways
he gave the little pony a chance to get in some
dents. But he may be badly hurt, Frank," Bob
went on, his natural kindness of heart cropping up
above any feeling of animosity he might have
experienced.</p>

<p>"I suppose, then, we'll just have to tote the
beggar to the tent, and start up that fire again,
while we look him over. If those hind feet came
slap against his ribs, the chances are we'll find a
few of them broken."</p>

<p>Swinging their rifles into one hand they managed
to take hold of the grunting Moqui, and in
this primitive fashion began hauling him along.
Buckskin continued to prance and snort as though
demanding whether he had not amply fulfilled his
duty as guardian to the camp; but no one paid the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
least attention to him just then. Arriving at the
tent the boys proceeded to rekindle the fire.</p>

<p>"Why, he's coming to, Frank!" exclaimed
Bob, as, having finished his task, he turned to see
his chum bending over the victim of Buckskin's
hoofs, and noted that the would-be horse thief
was struggling to sit up.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he's hurt very bad," Frank
declared. "I've felt all over his body, and don't
seem to find any signs of broken bones."</p>

<p>"Listen to him gasp right now, as if the breath
had been knocked out of him," remarked Bob.
"He's going to speak, Frank, sure he is. I wonder
can we understand what he says. Moqui
wasn't included in my education at the Military
Institution at Frankfort."</p>

<p>The Indian was indeed trying to get enough
air in his lungs to enable him to say something.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>

<h3>"TALK ABOUT LUCK!"</h3>
<br />

<p>"No hurt Havasupai!" was what he managed
to say, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"We're not going to hurt you, old man," remarked
Frank; for he had seen that the Indian
was no stripling. "What we want to know is,
how you came to get so close to the heels of my
horse as to be kicked? Tell us that, Havasupai,
if you please."</p>

<p>There was no answer, although twice the exhausted
red man opened his lips as if to speak.</p>

<p>"That knocks the props out from under him,
Frank," remarked Bob; "because he was bent on
getting away with one or both mounts."</p>

<p>"How about that, Havasupai; weren't you
thinking of stealing a horse, when that animal
just keeled you over so neatly?" Frank demanded.</p>

<p>The Indian was sitting up now. His head was
hanging low on his chest. Perhaps it was shame
that caused this: or it might have been a desire to
keep his face hidden from the searching eyes of
the white boys.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>

<p>Then, as though realizing the utter folly of
denying what must appear so evident, he nodded
his head slowly.</p>

<p>"It is true, white boy," he muttered, in fair
English. "Havasupai meant to take a horse.
He had looked upon the man who beckons, and
he was afraid, because he had trouble at his village.
He believed every man's hand was against
him. And so he would flee to the desert where
the white man's big medicine would not find him.
There he might die with the poison snakes and
the whooping birds."</p>

<p>Bob was of course puzzled by some of the
things the Indian said.</p>

<p>"What does he mean, Frank?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I take it the warrior has been in some sort
of fuss at his village," the other replied. "Perhaps
he even struck his chief in anger, and that
made an offense punishable with death. These
Moqui Indians are a queer lot, anyhow, I've
heard. Then he must have skipped out, and by
accident seeing our friend, Sheriff Stanwix, known
to him as the 'man who beckons,' he just imagined
they were looking for him."</p>

<p>"And that locoed him so much that he just
couldn't stand it any longer," Bob said. "Discovering
our camp he got the notion in his head
that a horse might take him out of the danger
zone. So he was in the act of jumping on one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
our mounts when your clever little beast took a
hand, or rather a hoof, in the matter. But do
you know what he means by whooping birds?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can give a guess," replied Frank.
"That must mean the little owl that lives with
the prairie dogs in their holes, along with the
poison snake, otherwise the rattler."</p>

<p>"Looks like we've just got our hands full to-night,
Frank!"</p>

<p>"You're right, Bob. First we feed two hungry
sheriffs, and pick up quite a little news about the
bad men they're looking for. Next, along comes
this Moqui, Havasupai he says his name is, and
he gets in a bad fix by trying to run off our horses;
and feeling sorry for the old chap we lug him to
our tent, and look him over, ready to even bind
up his wounds, if he has any."</p>

<p>"Getting to be a habit, isn't it, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Seems like it," returned the taller boy, as he
once more turned toward the seated Indian.
"Here, can you tell us where my horse kicked
you?"</p>

<p>"It matters not much. Havasupai get what
he needs because he try to steal horse from good
white boys," came the humble reply.</p>

<p>"One thing sure," remarked Frank aside to his
chum, "he's been in touch with the whites a heap,
or he wouldn't know how to talk as he does. But
then, that isn't so queer. You know that these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
Moquis pick up a lot of good coin from the travelers
who come and go at the Grand Canyon."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," Bob went on to say, "I've always
heard that one of the sights of this wonderland
was the snake dance of the Moquis. I read an
account of it in a magazine once. It said that
hundreds of people gathered from many quarters
to be on hand and see it, because it occurs only
once a year. Some of them were big guns in
science, too."</p>

<p>"They're getting more and more interested in
these Indians of the Southwest," Frank continued;
"and trying all the time to find out just where
they fit in the long-ago past. That's what made
old Uncle Felix, who had already made a name
for himself, give up his happy home, and hide all
these months down here. He wants to learn the
long-buried secrets of the past history of the
Zunis, the Moquis, and other tribes that might
have sprung from the old cliff builders."</p>

<p>"But what can we do with this fellow, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Oh! well, nothing much, I reckon," the other
answered, carelessly. "He must have been
plum locoed at seeing the sheriff, and hardly knew
what he was doing when he set out to grab Buckskin.
We'll just have to let him sleep here till
morning, and then give him a bite of breakfast."</p>

<p>"Just as you say, Frank; you ought to know
what's best," Bob hastened to declare. "Now I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
wonder what'll be the next thing on the programme?
I hope we don't have the two men the
sheriff is hunting, drop in to make us a call."</p>

<p>"Little danger of that now," Frank remarked
reassuringly. "By this time they're well on their
way to Flagstaff. Here, Havasupai, as you call
yourself; we don't mean to do you any harm, even
if you did play us a mean trick when you tried to
steal a mount. Understand?"</p>

<p>The old Indian looked up at Frank through
his masses of coarse black hair, just beginning to
be streaked with gray.</p>

<p>"Not do any harm," he repeated, as though
hardly able to grasp the meaning of the words
Frank spoke; then his brown face lighted up with
a grim smile. "White boys good; Havasupai
glad him not take horse. Bad Indian! But
not always that way; him carry speaking paper
tell how make good," and he thumped his breast
as he said this.</p>

<p>Again did Bob's eyes seek the face of his chum
in a questioning manner. Frank, having been
raised amid such scenes, could more readily understand
what the Moqui meant when he referred
to certain things which Bob had never heard mentioned
before.</p>

<p>"He means that he's got a letter of recommendation
along with him, written by some tourist,
I reckon. Perhaps this old fellow may have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
found a chance to do some one a good turn. He
may have run across a greenhorn wandering on
the desert; saved a fellow who had been stabbed
by the fangs of a viper from the Gila; or helped
him to camp when he broke a leg in climbing
around the Grand Canyon."</p>

<p>"Oh! I see what you mean, Frank; that this
party wrote out a recommendation to all concerned,
stating that in his opinion Havasupai was
a fine fellow, and worth trusting. But then that
was before he got into this trouble at this village.
If he's a fugitive from justice at the hands of his
own tribe, such a paper isn't worth much, I guess."</p>

<p>"No more it isn't," agreed Frank.</p>

<p>"But all the same he means to stick us with it,"
chuckled Bob; "for you can see he's got his hand
in his shirt right now, as if searching for something
so valuable that he won't even carry it in his
ditty bag."</p>

<p>"That's right, Bob."</p>

<p>"And now he's got in touch with that old letter,"
grunted Bob. "I suppose we'll just have
to read it to please him."</p>

<p>"You can if you care to," remarked Frank.
"As for me, I'm that sleepy I only want a
chance to crawl back into the tent, and take up my
interrupted nap where it broke off."</p>

<p>"But good gracious! do you really mean it?"
exclaimed the puzzled Bob.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>

<p>"Why not?" demanded his chum.</p>

<p>"And leave him loose here, with the horses
close by?" Bob went on, aghast.</p>

<p>At that Frank laughed a little.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, drily; "so far as the horses
are concerned, I reckon our old friend Havasupai
will go a long way on foot before he ever tries to
steal a promising looking pony again. As long
as he lives he'll remember how it feels to get a
pair of hoofs fairly planted against his back. So
long, Bob. Tell the old fraud he can lie down
anywhere he pleases, and share our breakfast in
the morning."</p>

<p>"That's the way you rub it in, Frank; returning
evil with good," the Kentucky boy remarked.
"But since you want me to take him in hand, I'll
be the victim, and read his letter of recommendation,
though I can already guess what it will
say."</p>

<p>The old Moqui had meanwhile succeeded in
getting out the paper which he seemed to set so
much store by. Looking up, and seeing that
Frank had turned away, he offered it to Bob,
who took it gravely, and proceeded to hold it so
that the light of the little fire would fall upon
the writing.</p>

<p>Frank was half way in the tent when he heard
his chum give utterance to a shout. He backed
out again, and turning, looked hastily, half expecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
to see Bob engaged in a tussle with the
old Indian.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort met his gaze. The Moqui
was sitting there, staring at Bob, who had
straightened up, and was starting to dance around,
holding the paper in his extended hand.</p>

<p>"What ails you, Bob?" demanded the other.
"Haven't been taken with a sudden pain, after
all that venison you stowed away, I hope."</p>

<p>"Come out here, Frank!" called the lad by
the fire. "Of all the luck! to think we'd strike
such a piece as this! It's rich! It's the finest
ever! We go to hunt for clues, and here they
come straight to us. Talk to me about the favors
of fortune, why, we're in it up to the neck!"</p>

<p>"You seem to be tickled about something, Bob;
has that paper any connection with it?" demanded
Frank.</p>

<p>"Well I should say, yes, by a big jugfull," replied
the Kentucky boy. "And you'll agree with
me when I tell you it's signed by Professor Felix
Oswald, the very man we're going to search the
Grand Canyon up and down to find!"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>THE COPPER COLORED MESSENGER</h3>

<br />

<p>"Do you really mean it, Bob?" asked Frank,
with the bewildered air of one who suspects a
joke.</p>

<p>"Take it yourself, and see," replied the other,
holding out the discolored and wrinkled sheet on
which the writing was still plainly to be read.</p>

<p>Frank bent over, the better to allow the firelight
to fall upon the queer document. This was
what he read in a rather crabbed hand, though
the writing could be read fairly well:</p>

<p><i>"To Whom it May Concern; Greeting!</i></p>

<p>"This is to certify to the good character of
the bearer, a Moqui Indian by the name of Havasupai,
who has rendered me a very great service,
which proves him to be the friend of the white
man, and a believer in the pursuit of science. I
cheerfully recommend him to all who may be in
need of a trustworthy and capable guide to the
Grand Canyon.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 20em;">"<span class="smcap">Professor Oswald.</span></span>"</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>

<p>Frank looked up to see the grinning face of his
chum thrust close to him.</p>

<p>"Think it's genuine, Frank?" demanded the
other.</p>

<p>"I can see no reason why it shouldn't be," answered
the other, glancing down again at the
crumpled paper he held, and which the old Moqui
was regarding with the greatest of pride on his
brown face.</p>

<p>"Looks like that paper Mr. Hinchman
brought to my dad; yes, I'd stake my word on
it, Bob, that the same hand wrote both."</p>

<p>"But how d'ye suppose this greasy old Indian
ever got the document?" asked the young Kentuckian.</p>

<p>"We'll have to put it up to him, and find out,"
came the reply. "He can speak United States
all right; we've found that out already; and so
you see, there's no reason under the sun why he
shouldn't want to tell us."</p>

<p>He turned to the Moqui. It was not the same
sleepy boy apparently who, but a minute before,
had started to creep into the comfortable tent,
where the blankets lay; but a wide-awake fellow,
eager to ascertain under what conditions this fugitive
brave could have secured such a letter of
recommendation from the man of science, who
was supposed to have utterly vanished from the
haunts of men without leaving a single trace behind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
up to the hour that message came to Colonel
Haywood.</p>

<p>Holding the paper up, and shaking it slightly,
Frank started to put the Moqui warrior on the
rack.</p>

<p>"This belong to you, Havasupai?" he demanded,
trying to assume a stern manner, such
as he believed would affect the other more or
less, and be apt to bring out straight answers
to his leading questions.</p>

<p>"The white boy has said," answered the other,
for an Indian seldom answers in a direct way.</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?" Frank continued,
slowly, as if feeling his way; for he did not wish
to alarm the Indian, knowing how obstinate a
Moqui may prove if he once suspects that he is
being coaxed into betraying some secret or a
friend.</p>

<p>The black, bead-like eyes were on the face of
Frank as he put these questions. Doubtless the
old Moqui balanced every one well before venturing
a reply.</p>

<p>"He gave it," nodding in the direction of the
paper Frank held.</p>

<p>"Do you mean the man who signed his name
here, Professor Oswald?"</p>

<p>A nod of the head in the affirmative settled
that question.</p>

<p>"Was he a small man with a bald head, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
hair on top, and wearing glasses over his eyes,
big, staring glasses?"</p>

<p>Frank aided comprehension by touching the top
of his own head when speaking about the loss of
hair on the part of the noted scientist; and then
made rings with his fingers and thumbs which
he clapped to his eyes as though looking through
a pair of spectacles.</p>

<p>Evidently the Moqui understood. Reading
signs was a part of his early education. In fact
it comprised nearly four-fifths of all the Indian
knew.</p>

<p>"White boy heap wise; he know that the man
give Havasupai talking paper. Much great man;
know all. Tell Havasupai about cliff men. Find
much good cook pot, heap more stuff in cave.
Find out how cave men live. Write all down in
book. Send Havasupai one, promise. It is
well!"</p>

<p>"But where did you meet him?" asked Frank;
and he saw at once that this was getting very near
the danger line, judging from the manner in
which the Moqui acted; for he seemed to draw
back, just as the alarmed tortoise will hide its
head in its shell at the first sign of peril.</p>

<p>"In canyon where picture rocks laugh at sun,"
the Indian slowly said.</p>

<p>"That ought to stand for the Grand Canyon,"
remarked the boy.</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>

<p>The keen ears of the Moqui caught the words,
although they were almost spoken in whispers,
and only intended for Bob.</p>

<p>He nodded violently, and Frank somehow
found himself wondering whether, after all, the
shrewd Indian might not be wanting to deceive
him. He may have conceived the idea that these
two white boys were the enemies of the queer old
professor; and for that reason would be careful
how he betrayed the man who trusted him.</p>

<p>"Listen, Moqui," said Frank, putting on a
serious manner, so as to impress the other; "we
are the friends of the little-old-man who has no
hair on top of his head. We want to see him,
talk with him! It means much good to him. He
will be glad if you help us find him. Do you
understand that?"</p>

<p>The Indian's black eyes roved from one to the
other of those bright young faces. Apparently
he would be foolish to suspect even for a minute
that the two lads could have any evil design in
their minds.</p>

<p>Still, the crafty look on his brown face grew
more intense.</p>

<p>"He has some good reason for refusing to accommodate
us, I'm afraid," Bob said just then,
as if he too had read the signs of that set countenance.</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer me, Moqui?" Frank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
insisted, bent on knowing the worst. "We are
on the way now to find the man who gave you
this letter that talks. We have some good news
for him. And you can help us if you will only
tell in what part of the Grand Canyon Echo Cave
lies."</p>

<p>The Indian seemed to ponder. Evidently his
mind worked slowly, when it tried to grapple with
secrets. But one thing he knew, and this must
be some solemn promise he had made the man of
science, never under any conditions to betray his
hiding-place to a living soul.</p>

<p>"No can say; in canyon where picture rocks
lie; that all," he finally declared, and Frank
knew Indians well enough to feel sure that no
torture could be painful enough to induce Havasupai
to betray one he believed his friend, and
whose magic talking paper he carried inside his
shirt, to prove his good character.</p>

<p>"That settles it, Bob, I'm afraid," he remarked
to his chum, who had been listening
eagerly to all that was being said. "You might
try all sorts of terrible things and he wouldn't
whisper a word, even if he believed all we told
him."</p>

<p>"That's tough," observed Bob; "but anyhow,
we've got something out of it all, because we
know now that the silly old professor must be
hiding in one of those cliff caves, trying to read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
up the whole life history of the queer people who
dug their homes out of the solid rock, tier after
tier, away up the face of the cliffs."</p>

<p>"True for you, Bob, and I'm glad to see how
you take it. I had hoped the Moqui might make
our job easier, as he could do, all right, if only
he wanted to tell us a few things. But we're no
worse off than we were before, in all things, and
some better in a few."</p>

<p>"I wish I could talk Moqui," declared Bob;
"and perhaps then I'd be able to make the old
fellow understand. Perhaps, Frank, if you gave
him a little note to Uncle Felix, he might promise
to take it to him later on!"</p>

<p>"Hello! that's a good idea, I declare," exclaimed
Frank; "and I'll just do that same while
I think of it."</p>

<p>He immediately drew out a pad of paper, and
a fountain pen which he often carried for business
purposes, since there were times when he had
to sign documents as a witness for his father.</p>

<p>The old Moqui watched him closely. Evidently
the spider-like handwriting was a deep
mystery to him, and he must always feel a certain
amount of respect for any white person who could
communicate with another by means of the "talking
paper."</p>

<p>"There," said Frank, presently, "that ought
to do the business, I reckon."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>

<p>"What did you say?" asked his comrade, who
was busy at the fire just then, drawing some of
the partly-burned wood aside, so that their supply
might hold out in the morning.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Frank went on, "I told him dad had
his note, sent in that bottle. Then I mentioned
the important fact that the mine paper he carried
had increased in value thousands of dollars.
And I wound up by telling him how much we
wanted to see and talk with him. I signed my
name, and yours, to the note."</p>

<p>"And now to see whether the Moqui will
promise to carry it to your great-uncle."</p>

<p>Frank held the note up.</p>

<p>"You will not tell us where we can find the
little man without any hair on his head, Havasupai,"
he said. "But surely you will not say no
when I ask you to carry this talking paper to him.
It will please him very much. He will shake
your hand, and many times thank you. How?"</p>

<p>The cautious old Moqui seemed to be weighing
chances in his suspicious mind.</p>

<p>"Three to one he thinks we mean to spy on
him, and find it all out that way," was Bob's
quick opinion.</p>

<p>"Just what was in my mind; I could read it
in his sly old face. But all the same he's going
to consent, Bob."</p>

<p>The Kentucky boy wondered how Frank could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
tell this. He was even more surprised when the
Indian stretched out a hand for the note, as he
said solemnly:</p>

<p>"Havasupai will carry the talking paper to the
man who has no hair on his head. But no eye
must see him do it. The white boys must say to
Havasupai that they will not try to follow him."</p>

<p>Frank looked at his chum, and nodded.</p>

<p>"We'll just have to do it, I guess, to satisfy
the suspicious old fraud, Bob," he remarked; and
then raising his hand, while his chum did likewise
Frank went on, addressing the Moqui, who
watched every action with glittering black eyes:
"We promise not to follow, Havasupai, and will
hope that this talking paper may cause the man-who-hides
to send you for us to take us to him.
You understand all that I am saying, don't
you?"</p>

<p>The Moqui said something in his native
language, which of course neither of them comprehended.
But at the same time he reached out
his hand and deliberately took the note intended
for Uncle Felix.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! he's going to act as our messenger!"
exclaimed Bob, filled with anticipations
of success. "Say, that was a pretty smart dodge
on our part, after all. But it makes me hold my
breath every time I think of our good luck in
running across this chap the way we did. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
Buckskin deserves all the credit. He did it with
his wonderful little tap."</p>

<p>"All right," said Frank; "me for the land of
sleep now! Havasupai, you can lie down where
you will. In the morning we promise you a share
of our meat. How?"</p>

<p>"It is well, white boy," replied the old Moqui,
as he dropped in a heap, and evidently meant to
sleep just as he was without any further preparations.</p>

<p>Bob also crawled into the tent, although he had
some misgivings, and wondered whether his
chum were really doing a wise thing to trust one
who had just confessed to a desire to raid their
horses.</p>

<p>But as Bob, too, was tired and sleepy, he soon
forgot all his suspicions in slumber. When he
awoke he could see the daylight peeping under
the canvas. Without disturbing his companion,
Bob immediately started to crawl out. He had
suddenly remembered the old Moqui; and it
seemed as though his fears must have returned
two-fold, and nothing would do but that he must
hasten to make sure all was well.</p>

<p>Frank was just opening his eyes a little while
later when he saw Bob's head thrust in at the
opening of the tent.</p>

<p>"Better get up, Frank," the other said. "I've
started the fire, and after we've had breakfast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
we'll be on our way. It was just as you said,
though; he had the good sense to keep clear of
the heels of the horses."</p>

<p>"Who are you talking about, the Moqui?"
asked Frank, sitting up suddenly, as he caught a
peculiar strain in the other's voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, our friend, Havasupai; who vamoosed
in the night!" laughed Bob.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>AT THE GRAND CANYON</h3>
<br />

<p>"Do you mean it?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"Come out, and see for yourself," Bob returned.
"I've looked all around, and not a sign
of the old fellow can I find."</p>

<p>"And both horses are there?" Frank continued,
making a break for the exit.</p>

<p>"As fine as you please. Our friend didn't
want a second try from those clever heels of
Buckskin. He gave them a wide berth when he
cleared out, I warrant. Oh! you can look everywhere,
and you won't see a whiff of Havasupai.
He's skipped by the light of the moon, all right."</p>

<p>Bob backed off, as his chum walked this way
and that. He grinned as though he really enjoyed
the whole thing. In his mind he had
figured that it would turn out something this
way, so he was not very much surprised.</p>

<p>"What d'ye think, Frank," he exclaimed,
presently; "don't you remember promising to
share our venison at breakfast with the Moqui?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, to be sure I do; but what of that,
Bob?"</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>

<p>"Only that he didn't forget," laughed the
other.</p>

<p>Frank immediately glanced toward the carcase
of the little antelope.</p>

<p>"Ginger! he did go and cut himself a piece
from it, sure enough," he admitted.</p>

<p>"While he thought our company not as nice
as our room, still, he didn't object to sharing our
meat. And, Frank, he wasn't at all stingy about
the amount he took, either," Bob complained.</p>

<p>"Oh! well, I reckon there's still enough for
us, and to spare. Besides, we've got heaps of
other things along in our packs, for an emergency,
you know. Suppose we make a pot of coffee, and
start things."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Frank; I'll attend to it," declared
Bob; "but why under the sun do you suppose
now, that sly old Moqui dodged out like
that?"</p>

<p>"Well, for one thing, he may have suspected
us," replied Frank.</p>

<p>"What! after all we did for him, took him in,
and forgave his sins, even to offering to mend any
broken ribs, if he'd had any, through that horse
kick? I can't just understand that," Bob ventured,
while he measured out enough ground
coffee to make a pot of the tempting hot beverage.</p>

<p>"He took the alarm, it seems," Frank went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
on, indifferently. "Knew we wanted to find the
man who had given him the talking paper; and
was afraid we might try to make him tell; or,
that failing, stalk him when he went to deliver
my note. And on the whole I can't much blame
the old Indian. Suspicion is a part of their
nature. He believed he was on the safe side in
slipping away as he did. Forget it, Bob. We've
learned a heap by his just dropping in on us, I
think."</p>

<p>"Sure we have," replied the other, being busily
employed over the fire just then. "And I was
thinking what he could have meant when he
pointed off in the direction I calculate the Grand
Canyon lies, and said in answer to one of your
questions: 'Seek there! When the sun is red it
shines in Echo Cave!'"</p>

<p>"I've guessed that riddle, and it was easy,"
Frank remarked.</p>

<p>"Then let me hear about it, because I'm pretty
dull when it comes to understanding all this lovely
sign language of the Indians," Bob remarked.</p>

<p>"Listen, then. The sun is said to be red when
its setting; that's plain enough; isn't it, Bob?"</p>

<p>"All O.K. so far, Frank. I won't forget that
in a hurry, either."</p>

<p>"Then, when he said it looked into the cave
at sunset, it was another way of telling us the
cave faced the west!" Frank continued.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>

<p>"Well, what a silly chap I was not to guess
that," chuckled the other.</p>

<p>"And from what I know about the bigness of
that canyon, Bob, I think that this unknown Echo
Cave must be pretty high up on the face of a big
cliff to the east of the river."</p>

<p>"Why high up? I don't get on to any reason
for your saying that?" inquired Bob.</p>

<p>"You'll see it just as soon as I mention why,"
remarked his companion. "When the sun is going
down in the west, far beyond the horizon,
don't you see that it can only shine along the very
upper part of the cliffs? The lower part is already
lost in the shadows that drop late in the
afternoon in all canyons."</p>

<p>"Of course, and it's as plain to me now as the
nose on my face," agreed Bob. "Queer, how easy
we see these things after they've been explained."</p>

<p>It did not take long to prepare breakfast, and
still less time to eat it once the coffee and venison
were ready. Just as Frank had said, there
was plenty of the meat for the meal.</p>

<p>"That was a mighty juicy little antelope, all
right," remarked Bob, as he finished his last bite,
and prepared to get up from the ground where
he had been enjoying his ease during the meal.</p>

<p>"And for one I don't care how soon you repeat
the dose," remarked Frank; "only it will be a
long day before you get one of the timid little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
beasts as easy as that accommodating chap fell
to your gun. Why, he was just a gift, that's all
you could call it, Bob."</p>

<p>"That's what I've been thinking myself, though
of course I don't know as much about them as
you do, by a long shot," Bob admitted. "I suppose
it's us to hit the saddle again now?"</p>

<p>"We're going to try and make Flagstaff by
night," Frank announced, as he picked up his saddle
and bridle, and walked toward the spot where
Buckskin was staked out.</p>

<p>The horses had been able to drink all they
wanted during the night, for the ropes by means
of which they were tethered allowed of a range
that took them to the little spring hole from which
the water gushed, to run away, and, in the end,
possibly unite with the wonderful Colorado.</p>

<p>In ten minutes more the boys were off at a
round gallop. There was no intention of pushing
their mounts so soon in the day. Like most
persons who have spent much time on horseback
both lads knew the poor policy of urging
an animal to its best speed in the early part of
a journey, especially one that is to be prolonged
for ten or twelve hours.</p>

<p>At noon they were far enough advanced for
Frank to declare he had no doubt about being
able to make Flagstaff before sunset.</p>

<p>"When we get there, and spend a night at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
hotel, we must remember and ask if our friend
Mr. Stanwix and his partner arrived in good
time, and went on," Bob suggested.</p>

<p>Just as Frank had expected, they made the
town on the railroad before the sun had dropped
out of sight; and the horses were in fair condition
at that.</p>

<p>Flagstaff only boasts of a normal population
of between one and two thousand; but there are
times, with the influx of tourists bound for the
Grand Canyon, when it is a lively little place.</p>

<p>The two boys only desired shelter and rest for
themselves and their horses during the night. It
was their intention to push on early the following
day, keeping along the old wagon trail that at one
time was the sole means of reaching the then
little known Wonderland along the deeply sunk
Colorado.</p>

<p>After a fairly pleasant night, they had an
early breakfast. The horses proved to be in fine
fettle, and eager for the long gallop. So the two
saddle boys once more started forth.</p>

<p>The day promised to be still warmer than the
preceding one; and the first part of the journey
presented some rather difficult problems. They
managed to put the San Francisco Mountains behind
them, however, and from that on the dash
was for the most part over a fairly level plateau.</p>

<p>Now and then they were threading the trail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
through great pine forests, and again it was a
mesa that opened up before them.</p>

<p>Bob was especially delighted.</p>

<p>"Think we'll make it, Frank?" he asked,
about the middle of the afternoon, as they cantered
along, side by side, the horses by this time
having had pretty much all their "ginger" as
Bob called it taken out of them, though still able
to respond to a sudden emergency, had one arisen.</p>

<p>"I reckon so," replied the other. "According
to my map we're within striking distance right
now. Given two more hours, and we'll possibly
sight the border of the big hole. That was Red
Horse Tank we just passed, you know," and he
pointed out their position on the little chart to
Bob.</p>

<p>It was half an hour to sundown when the well
known Grand View Hotel stood out in plain sight
before them; and before the shades of night commenced
to fall, the tired boys had thrown themselves
from their saddles, seen to the comfort of
the faithful steeds, and mounted to the porch of
the hotel for a flitting view of the amazing
spectacle that spread itself before them, ere darkness
hid its wonderful and majestic beauty.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>HOW THE LITTLE TRAP WORKED</h3>

<br />

<p>"What do you think of it?" asked Frank,
after they had stood there a short time, taking in
the picture as seen in the late afternoon.</p>

<p>"It's hard to tell," Bob replied slowly. "It's
so terribly big, that a fellow ought to take his
time letting the thing soak in. That further wall
looks as if you could throw a stone over to it;
and yet they say it's more than a mile from here."</p>

<p>"Yes," Frank went on, "and all along in the
Grand Canyon there are what seem to be little
hills, every one of which is a mountain in itself.
They only look small in comparison with the
tremendous size of the biggest gap in the whole
world."</p>

<p>"And how far does this thing run&mdash;is it fifty
miles in length?" Bob asked.</p>

<p>"I understand that the river runs through this
canyon over two hundred miles," the other replied.
"And all the way there are scores, if not
hundreds, of smaller canyons and 'washes,'
reaching out like the fingers of a whopping big
hand; or the feelers of a centipede."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>

<p>"That's what I read about it away back; but
I had forgotten," Bob remarked. "And they say
that it would be a year's trip to try and follow the
Grand Canyon all the way down from beginning
to end, only on one side."</p>

<p>"I reckon it would, for you'd have to trace
every one of these lateral gashes up to its source,
so as to cross over. And that would mean
thousands of miles to be covered."</p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed Bob, throwing up his hands
as he spoke; "when you say that, it makes a fellow
have some little idea of the size of this hole.
And to think it's come just by the river eating
away the soil!"</p>

<p>"They call that erosion," remarked Frank,
who had of course posted himself on many of
these facts, during his previous visit to the
canyons of the Little Colorado. "It's been going
on for untold thousands of years; and as the
river with its tributaries has gradually eaten away
the soil and rocks, it has left the grandest pictured
and colored walls ever seen in any part of this
old earth."</p>

<p>"When that afternoon sun shines on the red
rocks it makes them look almost like blood," declared
Bob. "And already I'm glad we came.
I think just now I could be happy spending months
prowling around here, finding new pictures every
day."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>

<p>"Then you don't blame old Uncle Felix for
staying, do you?" laughed Frank.</p>

<p>"Sure I don't," returned the other lad, with
vehemence. "And besides, you must remember
that he had another string to his bow."</p>

<p>"Meaning his craze to be the fortunate man
of science to unravel the mystery that has always
hung over the homes of those cliff dwellers?"
Frank went on.</p>

<p>"I can understand how it must appeal to a
man living as Professor Felix has all these years,"
mused Bob. "And think of those queer old fellows
picking out this one place of all the wide
country to build their homes."</p>

<p>"That was because there could be no place
that offered them a tenth of the advantages this
did," Frank remarked, pointing across the wide
chasm to the towering heights that could be seen.
"Think of hundreds of miles of such cliffs to
choose from! And as the softer rock was washed
out by the action of floods countless ages ago,
leaving the harder in the shape of astonishing
shelves and buttes, these people took a lesson
from nature, and carved their roomy homes by
following the pliable stone."</p>

<p>"Say," Bob exclaimed, "that makes me think
of what I read about the catacombs of Rome;
how, for hundreds of miles, they run in every
direction, following the course of veins of earth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
in the rock, that were selected by those who dug
'em."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Frank, "these people built
their homes up in the cliffs in order to be safe.
Nobody seems to know what they were afraid of,
whether savage tribes, or great beasts that may
have roamed this part of the country a thousand
and more years ago."</p>

<p>"And that's the bait that has drawn the old
scientist here, to study it all out, and write up the
history of the people who looked on this very
picture so many hundreds of years back. Why,
Frank, some of the cliffs they say are about a
mile high! That's hard to believe, for a fact."</p>

<p>"But it's been proved true," the other asserted.
"The trouble is, that everything here is
on such an awful big scale that a fellow fools
himself. Actual measurement is the only way to
prove things. The eye goes back on you. Why,
I've looked out on a clear day in Colorado, and
believed I could walk to a mountain in an hour.
They told me it's base was fifty miles away; and
there you are."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to put off looking till morning,"
said Bob, regretfully; "because the sun's
dropped out of sight, and it's getting pretty thick
down there in the hole. And to think that to-morrow
we'll be pushing along through that place,
with the walls shutting us in on both sides."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>

<p>"Not only to-morrow, but for many days, perhaps,"
Frank added; for more than ever did he
begin to realize the enormous task that confronted
them; it was almost like looking for a
needle in a haystack; but if one possesses a
powerful magnet, even then the bit of steel may
be recovered in time.</p>

<p>Did they happen to know of any such magnet?</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously Frank's thoughts went
out toward that old Moqui brave, Havasupai,
who had fled from his village because of some
act which he had committed; but who was now
determined to return, and take his punishment
with the stoicism Indians have always shown.</p>

<p>The Moqui might be the connecting link! He
alone knew where the hermit had his lodging, possibly
in one of those quaint series of cliff dwellers'
homes, which for some reason he called Echo
Cave.</p>

<p>"We must ask if our friend Sheriff Stanwix
has been here," Bob suggested, as they went to
their room to prepare for supper.</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied his chum, "I did that when I
spoke with the clerk at the desk. You were looking
after the ponies at the time, so as to make
sure they'd be well taken care of for a week, or a
month if necessary."</p>

<p>"And what did he tell you, Frank?"</p>

<p>"They got here, all right," came the reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
"If you'd looked sharp when you were out there
in the hotel stables, you might have recognized
both their mounts; for they left them here at
noon to-day."</p>

<p>"Noon!" echoed Bob; "then they made
mighty good work of it, to get ahead of us all
that time. I reckon you're going to tell me they've
gone down into the canyon, and put in several
hours looking for their birds, the two fellows
who've given 'em the merry laugh more'n a few
times."</p>

<p>"Guessed right the first shot," Frank went on,
"but all that doesn't concern us one half as much
as some other information I struck."</p>

<p>"And you've been keeping it back from me,
while we stood there on the piazza, admiring the
wonderful view," Bob remarked, with a touch
of reproach in his voice.</p>

<p>"There were people passing us, all the time,"
his chum explained; "and besides, I wanted to
keep it until we were alone, so we could talk it
over."</p>

<p>"Is it about that scheming cousin of your
father's&mdash;what did you say his name was&mdash;Eugene
Warringford?"</p>

<p>"You got it straight enough," Frank admitted;
"and what I learned, was about him. I saw his
name on the register, and he's somewhere about
the hotel right now. I had a suspicion that I saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
some one trying to get near us while we stood
there, drinking in that picture; and Bob, while I
couldn't just hold up my hand and say for sure,
I think it was that tricky Abajo."</p>

<p>"The half-breed cowboy who left Circle Ranch
because he had some news for this Eugene that
the fellow would be apt to consider mighty
valuable, because it meant a stake of a million or
two dollars; is that right, Frank?"</p>

<p>"The same Abajo," his chum continued;
"which proves that those two are bound up in a
plot to win this game. If Eugene can only find
Uncle Felix he intends to get that paper in his
possession, by fair means or foul."</p>

<p>"Then it's up to us to put a stopper in his
little bottle!" declared Bob.</p>

<p>"I'm wondering," Frank proceeded, "whether
they've got any idea where to look for the man
who has hidden himself away for three years.
Perhaps they mean to keep tabs on us, and if we
are lucky enough to discover Uncle Felix, they
hope to jump in, and snatch away the prize before
we can warn him."</p>

<p>"Say, this is getting to be a pretty mix-up all
around," laughed the Kentucky lad. "Here we
are, meaning to try and follow the old Moqui; or
failing that, wait for him to fetch us a message
from the hermit of Echo Cave. Then Eugene,
and his shadow, Abajo, are hanging around with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
the idea of beating us at our game. Havasupai on
his part will be heading for the cave that lies in
an unknown part of the Grand Canyon, and all
the while dodging about for fear that he is followed."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Frank, falling in with the idea;
"and perhaps there are the Moquis from his village
who may have had word somehow of his return,
searching for Havasupai, and bent on bringing
him to the bar of their tribal law. To finish
the game, think of our friends, the two sheriffs,
loose in the big gash, and hunting for the men
who have snapped their fingers in their faces so
often across the line!"</p>

<p>"Well, it sure looks like there might be some
warm times coming," remarked Bob. "I suppose
we take our guns along with us when we're going
the rounds of the sights?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't think of doing anything else," was
Frank's reply. "No telling when we might need
'em. Suppose, now, those two rascals the sheriffs
are after should learn in some way about the
value of the paper Uncle Felix has with him,
wouldn't they just make it the game of their lives
to try and capture him? And I reckon Eugene,
too, will be so dead in earnest that he won't stop
at little things, backed up by such a reckless character
as the Mexican. Yes, the repeating rifles
go along, Bob!"</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>

<p>"This water feels fine after that long, dusty
and tiresome ride, eh?" remarked the young
Kentuckian, as he splashed in the deep basin, and
then proceeded to use the towel vigorously.</p>

<p>"It certainly does," Frank admitted, as he did
likewise.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the two boys went down to
supper. The hotel had its usual number of guests,
this being a favorite point for parties to start on
the tour.</p>

<p>"Don't look just now," said Frank, as they
sat at a table; "but Abajo has taken his seat right
back of you. And it wasn't accident, either, that
made him do it; I believe he has been set to watch
us!"</p>

<p>From time to time, as they ate, Frank would
report as to what the half-breed was doing; and
while nothing occurred to actually prove the fact,
still he saw no reason to change his mind.</p>

<p>"And I'm going to find out if he's keeping
an eye on us, so as to report to his employer,
Eugene Warringford," Frank announced, as they
were drawing near the end of the meal.</p>

<p>"That sounds good to me," Bob remarked;
"but how will you do it?"</p>

<p>For answer Frank drew out a paper from an
inner pocket.</p>

<p>"You see this document," he observed, with a
solemn look. "Well, it's only what you might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
call a dummy, being just an invitation I received
a little while back to invest in some worthless
mines over in the Hualpai Mountains of Mohave
County. I kept it, meaning to figure out how
these sharpers work their game. Now, when I
hand you this, look deeply interested, as though
it might be connected with the finding of Uncle
Felix."</p>

<p>"Oh! I see your move, and go you one better,
Frank."</p>

<p>For some little time they seemed to be conversing
intently. Frank would occasionally tap
the document, which he had sealed up in its
envelope, as though he laid great stress on it.
Finally he placed it on the table alongside his
plate, and kept on talking.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the boys left the table in
apparently such a hurry that they both forgot the
envelope that lay there, half hidden by a napkin.</p>

<p>Passing out of the room, they dodged back,
and peered around the corner of the doorway.</p>

<p>"There's the waiter at the table," said Bob.
"Now he's found the fine tip you left there, and
is putting it in his pocket, with a grin. If everybody
treated him as well as that, he'd soon be
owning one of these hotels himself, Frank."</p>

<p>"Watch!" remarked his chum, in a low
whisper. "Now he's discovered the document
lying there where I left it. He takes it up. Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
he sees another dollar coming to him when
he runs after us to return it."</p>

<p>"But there's somebody at his elbow," Bob
went on to say; "and it's Abajo, as sure as you
live. He's saying something, and I reckon telling
the waiter that you asked him to get the
packet. There, he slips some money in the fellow's
hand; and the waiter lets him take the
envelope. And we'd better slip behind this coat
rack here, for Abajo will be heading this way in
a hurry."</p>

<p>And hardly had they carried out that programme
ere the half-breed glided past, one hand
held in the pocket where he had thrust the "valuable"
document!<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>GOING DOWN THE CANYON TRAIL</h3>

<br />

<p>"Was I right?" asked Frank, after the half-breed
had disappeared.</p>

<p>"I should say yes," replied his chum, who had
followed the vanishing figure of Abajo with
staring eyes.</p>

<p>"He got the precious paper, all right, eh?"
Frank went on, chuckling.</p>

<p>"He sure did, and bribed our friend the waiter
to let him carry it off. Shows how you can trust
anybody in the tourist country, where they are
nearly all out for the money," Bob declared, indignation
struggling hard with a sense of humor.</p>

<p>"But just stop and think how easy Abajo,
sharp rascal that he is, rose to my little bait?"
laughed Frank. "Just as I expected, he was
watching us all the time we examined that wonderful
paper, and of course he believed it to be something
for which his employer would reward him
heavily, if he could only lay hands on it."</p>

<p>Bob himself was laughing now, as the full sense
of the ridiculous character of Frank's little joke
broke upon him.</p>

<p>"Oh! my, think what will happen when Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
Warringford tears open that envelope, and sees
how his spy has been fooled!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"There's only one bad thing about it, Bob!"</p>

<p>"What is that?" inquired the other.</p>

<p>"Eugene is, I take it, a clever fellow," said
Frank, seriously; "and he'll understand that this
was done with a purpose. It will make him suspect
that we're onto the game, and that we know
he has the half-breed watching our every move."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, only after this we may expect they'll
change their tactics more or less, and play on another
string of the fiddle," the other saddle boy
replied.</p>

<p>"All right," Bob remarked. "Forewarned is
forearmed, they say; and if we know Eugene is
laying low for us, we can be on our guard."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all very good," Frank went on,
shaking his head; "but once we get into the big
canyon it may pay us to keep an eye out for overhanging
rocks."</p>

<p>"Say, you don't mean to tell me you think
Eugene would go that far?" demanded Bob,
startled at the very idea of such a thing.</p>

<p>"I don't like to think he would; but you never
can tell," Frank replied. "When a man like
Eugene Warringford sells his soul, and with a
chance of getting a big stake, he is generally ready
to shut his eyes, and go the limit."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>

<p>"But, Frank, that would be terrible! One of
those rocks, coming down from the face of a high
cliff, would seriously injure us!"</p>

<p>"Sure it would, and on that account we must
keep on the watch all the time," Frank continued.
"But I don't see Abajo anywhere about the
piazza of the hotel; do you?"</p>

<p>"He's gone, and I reckon to carry that wonderful
find of his to the man who employs him," Bob
remarked. "Wouldn't I give a dollar to be hiding
close by when he runs across Eugene, and
they open the envelope you sealed! Wow! it
will be a regular circus! Can't you imagine that
yellow face of the half-breed turning more like
saffron then ever when he learns that we played
him for a softy?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you were near by, Bob, I wouldn't
be surprised if you just had to stick your fingers
in your ears," chuckled Frank.</p>

<p>"I reckon they will have a heap to say about
it; and Abajo, after this, won't take us for easy
marks, will he?" Bob remarked, in a satisfied
tone.</p>

<p>A short time later they were in their room.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose now, Frank, that we'll be
bothered to-night?" Bob observed, as he stood
there by the window looking out toward the
Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>At that the other laughed quite merrily.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>

<p>"Don't give yourself any uneasiness about
that, Bob," he remarked. "In the first place nobody
would bother trying to get up here, even if
they could, when so many better chances of reaching
us will crop up after we start into the canyon
to-morrow. Then again, we haven't anything to
be stolen but our rifles, and what little cash we
brought along for expenses."</p>

<p>"Oh! I suppose I am silly thinking about it,"
admitted Bob, "but some way that half-breed
seems to be on my nerves. His face is so sly, and
his black eyes just glitter as I've seen those of a
snake do when he's going to strike. But, just as
you say, it's foolish to borrow trouble, and I must
get those notions out of my head."</p>

<p>"That's the talk, Bob," his chum declared,
heartily. "Morning will find us in fine trim to
make a start into this big ditch. And before another
night you'll be so filled with wonder over
what you see that these other things will take a
back seat."</p>

<p>"But do you think we ever can find the hermit
of Echo Cave?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"I think we've got a pretty good chance, if
we're left alone," came the ready reply.</p>

<p>"Meaning if this Eugene Warringford keeps
his hands off; and nothing else turns up to balk
us?" Bob asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, all of that, and more," Frank admitted.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>

<p>"But already I find myself wishing we had
somebody along with us, like Old Hank Coombs
for instance, Frank."</p>

<p>"Well, who knows what may happen?" said
the other, a little mysteriously. "D'ye know,
Bob, I saw my dad winking at Hank when he
thought I wasn't looking; and on that account
I've got half an idea he meant to send the old
man, perhaps with a second cowboy, along on
our trail. We may run across friends here when
we least expect it."</p>

<p>"I hope it turns out that way," declared the
Kentucky boy; "because Hank is just what you
might call a tower of strength when he's along.
Remember how fortunate it was he turned up
when he did, at the time we wanted to follow
that plague of the cattle ranges, the wolf, Sallie?
I reckon we'd have had a much harder time bagging
our game if Hank hadn't been along."</p>

<p>"Well, get to bed now," Frank counseled;
"and let to-morrow look out for itself."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll be with you in three shakes
of a lamb's tail," declared Bob.</p>

<p>But before he left the window Frank noticed
that he thrust his head out, as if desirous of making
sure that no one could climb up the face of
the wall, and find entrance there while they slept.</p>

<p>Bob was not a timid boy as a rule; in fact he
was deemed rather bold; but just as he said, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
dark face of Abajo had impressed him unfavorably;
and he felt that the young half-breed would
be furious when he learned how neatly he had
been sold.</p>

<p>Nor did anything happen during that night as
they slept upon the border of the Wonderland.
Both lads enjoyed a peaceful sleep, and awoke
feeling as "fresh as fish," as Bob quaintly expressed
it.</p>

<p>Breakfast not being ready they walked about,
viewing the astonishing features of the canyon as
seen from the bluff on which the hotel stood.
Down in the tremendous gap mists were curling
up like little clouds, to vanish as they reached
the line where the sunlight fell. It was a sight
that appalled Bob, who declared that he felt as
though looking into the crater of some vast
volcano.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Frank, "they did have
volcanos around here, after this canyon was
pretty well formed, though perhaps thousands of
years ago. Great beds of lava have been found
down in the bottom of the hole, so my little guide
book tells me. But look away off there, Bob,
and see that peak standing up like the rim of a
cloud. Do you know what that is?"</p>

<p>"I heard one man say," Bob replied, quickly,
"Navajo Peak could be seen on a clear morning,
and perhaps that's the one; but Frank, just think,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
it's about a hundred and twenty miles off. Whew!
they do things on a big scale around here; don't
they? I'd call it the playground of giants."</p>

<p>"And you'd about hit the bulls eye," his chum
observed; "but there goes the call for breakfast."</p>

<p>"I feel as if I could stow away enough for a
crowd, this mountain air is so fresh and invigorating,"
Bob remarked, as they headed for the
dining room.</p>

<p>Half an hour later they were once more in
front of the hotel, and interviewing a guide who
had been recommended by the manager as an experienced
canyon man. It ended in their making
terms with John Henry, as the fellow gave his
name; though of course Frank was too wise to
tell him what their real object was in exploring
the tremendous gap. That could come later on.</p>

<p>At about nine o'clock they started down the
trail that led from Grand View into the depths
of the fearful dip. And as they descended, following
their guide, Bob found himself realizing
the colossal size of everything connected with
the rainbow-hued canyon walls.</p>

<p>Nor was his mind made any easier when Frank
took occasion, half an hour later, to bend toward
him, and say in the most natural manner possible,
though in low tones:</p>

<p>"They're on the job again, Bob&mdash;Abajo and
Eugene&mdash;because I happened to see them watching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
us start down the trail; and they had some one
along with them, perhaps a guide; so we'll have
to take it for granted that they mean to dog us all
the time, hoping to steal our thunder, if we make
any lucky find!"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>

<h3>THE HOME OF THE CLIFF DWELLERS</h3>

<br />

<p>Although Bob had anticipated such a thing,
still the knowledge that it was actually coming to
pass gave him a thrill. For some little time he
did not say anything; but Frank could see him
look uneasily up at the walls that now arose sheer
above their heads some hundreds of feet.</p>

<p>Frank had studied the situation as well as he
could, both from a map of the canyon which he
found in the little guide book, and his own observations.
All the while he kept before him
that admission on the part of the old Moqui
whom they had befriended, to the effect that the
Westering sun shone full in Echo Cave. So he
expected to find the home of the hermit-scientist
high up in the wall on the Eastern side of the
Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>First he intended heading toward the East,
and going just as far as they could. Days, and
perhaps weeks, might be spent in the search for
the strange cave that had once been the home
of those mysterious cliff people, which cavern Professor
Oswald was occupying while studying the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
lives and customs of the long departed people who
had dug these dwellings out of the rock.</p>

<p>At noon they had made good progress; but
when the tremendous size of that two hundred
mile canyon was taken into consideration, with its
myriad of side "washes," and minor canyons, the
distance that they had covered was, as Bob aptly
declared, but a "flea-bite" compared with the
whole.</p>

<p>And Frank declared time and again it had been
a lucky thought that caused his chum to suggest
that they bring the field glasses along. They
were in almost constant use. Far distant scenes
were brought close, and high walls could be examined
in a way that must have been impossible
with the naked eye.</p>

<p>Of course Frank was particularly anxious to
scrutinize every colored wall that faced the West.
The rainbow tints so plainly marked, tier above
tier, called out expressions of deep admiration
from the two lads; but all the while they were
on the watch for something besides.</p>

<p>When Frank ranged that powerful glass along
the ragged face of a towering cliff he was looking
eagerly for signs of openings such as marked the
windows of the homes fashioned by the strange
people of a past age.</p>

<p>During the afternoon they actually discovered
such small slits in the rock&mdash;at least they looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
like pencil markings to them when the guide first
pointed out the village of the ancient cliff dwellers;
though on closer acquaintance they found
that the openings were of generous size.</p>

<p>"Shall we climb up that straggly path along the
face of the wall, and see what the old things look
like?" asked Bob, as the guide made motions upward.</p>

<p>"Yes, we ought to have our first sight of such
places," Frank replied, in a cautious tone. "Not
that I expect we're going to find our hermit there,
or in any other village that's known to tourist
travel. But we ought to get an idea of what
these places are like, you see. Then we'll know
better what to expect. And perhaps the conditions
will teach us how to discover <i>his</i> hiding place."</p>

<p>Accordingly they started to climb upward, just
as many other tourists had been doing for years.
There were even places, "aisles of safety," Bob
called them, where one who was ascending, upon
happening to meet a descending investigator,
could squeeze into a hole in the rock until the
other had slipped by.</p>

<p>Of course it was a risky climb, and no lightheaded
person could ever dream of taking it. But
the two saddle boys were possessed of good nerves
and able to look downward toward the bottom of
the canyon, even when several hundred feet up in
the air.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>

<p>Then they entered the first hole. It seemed to
be a fair-sized apartment, and was connected with
a string of others, all running along the face of
the cliff; so that those who occupied them in the
long ago might have air and light.</p>

<p>The boys observed everything with the ordinary
curiosity expected of newcomers. Frank even investigated
to see if there were any signs to indicate
that those old dwellers in the canyon knew
about the use of fire; and soon decided that it was
so.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think about this?" Bob
asked, after they had roamed from one room to
another. "For my part I think I'd fancy living
in one of those three story adobe houses of
the Hopi Indians, we saw pictures of at the hotel;
or even a Navajo hogan. But one thing sure,
these people never had to worry about leaking
roofs."</p>

<p>"No," added Frank, laughing; "and floods
couldn't bother them, because the Colorado never
rose three hundred feet since it began cutting out
this canyon."</p>

<p>"And think of the grand view they had before
their doors, with the canyon in places as much as
thirteen miles across, and mountains in their dooryard,
looking like anthills," Bob went on impressively.</p>

<p>"Makes a fellow feel mighty small; doesn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
it?" Frank remarked, as he stepped to a window
to look out again.</p>

<p>"Makes me feel that I want to get down again
to the trail," admitted Bob. "I'm wondering
whether it's going to be much harder getting back
than it was coming up."</p>

<p>"That's always the case," Frank declared, "as
I've found out myself when climbing up a steep
cliff. But the guide is ready for you, Bob, if you
show signs of getting dizzy. You have seen that
he carries a rope along, just like the Swiss guides
do."</p>

<p>"Oh! come, Frank! Go easy with me; can't
you?" the other exclaimed. "I hope I'm not
quite so bad as that."</p>

<p>"All the same, Bob, don't take any chances;
and if you feel the least bit giddy, let me know.
This is a case where an ounce of prevention is
better than a pound of cure. And a stout rope is
a mighty good thing to feel when your foot slips."</p>

<p>It turned out, however, that the Kentucky lad
was as sure-footed as a mountain goat. He descended
the trail, with its several ladders, placed
there of course by modern investigators, without
the least show of timidity.</p>

<p>They continued along the bed of the wide canyon.
At times they followed the ordinary trail.
Then again Frank would express a desire to have
a closer look at some high granite wall that hovered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
for possibly a thousand feet, above the very
river itself; and this meant that they must negotiate
a passage for themselves.</p>

<p>No doubt John Henry, the guide, must have
thought them the queerest pair of tourists he had
ever led through the mysteries of the Grand Canyon.
But as yet Frank had not thought fit to enlighten
him. He was not altogether pleased with
the appearance of the guide, and wished to wait
until he knew a little more about his ways, before
entrusting him with their secret.</p>

<p>More than a few times during that day Frank
believed he had positive evidence that they were
being watched. Of course they met frequent
parties of pilgrims wandering this way and that,
as they drank in the tremendous glories of the
canyon; but occasionally the boy believed he had
seen a head thrust out from behind some rock in
their rear, and then hastily withdrawn again as he
looked.</p>

<p>Of course he could make a guess as to who was
taking such a interest in the progress of his chum
and himself. No one, save Eugene Warringford,
would bother for even a minute about what they
were doing, since richer quarry by far than a
couple of boys would catch the eye of any lawless
desperado, like those the two sheriffs were following,
bent on making a haul.</p>

<p>"Frank," said Bob, when the afternoon was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
drawing to a close, and they had begun to think of
picking out the spot where they would spend the
night; "tell me why you chose to head toward the
East instead of the other way, where Bright Angel
trail attracts so many tourists?"</p>

<p>Frank cast one glance toward the guide, as
if to make sure that John Henry was far enough
in advance not to be able to catch what was said.</p>

<p>"I had a reason, Bob," he remarked, seriously.
"Before we got down into the canyon, so as to
choose which way we would go, I talked with
several men who were coming up. And Bob, I
learned that an old Moqui Indian had been seen
heading toward the East late last night!"</p>

<p>"And you think it may have been our friend,
Havasupai?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure of it, from the descriptions
they gave me," came the answer.</p>

<p>"But Frank, think how impossible it seems
that he could have reached here almost as soon
as we did; unless the old warrior was able to
fly I don't see how it could be done."</p>

<p>"I'm just as much up a tree as you are, Bob,"
laughed the other; "but, all the same, I believe
the Moqui has arrived, and is on his way right
now to where Echo Cave lies."</p>

<p>"Then he must have an aeroplane to help him
out, for I don't see how else he could make it,"
Bob insisted.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>

<p>"Think for a minute, and you'll see it isn't actually
impossible," Frank continued. "He could
have made Flagstaff that night, just as we did."</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Bob, "that's a fact; for while
he said he was tired, and wanted a mount to fly
from his people, who were looking for him, still
I understand that these Moquis are wonderful
runners, and game to the last drop of the hat.
Oh! I grant you that he could have made Flagstaff
that night sometime."</p>

<p>"Well, Flagstaff is on the railroad, you
know," Frank remarked.</p>

<p>"Sure! I see now what you are hitting at,"
Bob observed; "the old Indian must have had
money, as all his kind have, what with the tips
given by tourists day after day. He could
have come to Grand View on the train. Frank,
once more I knuckle down to your superior wisdom.
That's what Havasupai must have done,
sure pop!"</p>

<p>"Anyhow," the other continued, "it pleases me
to believe so; and that the Moqui is even now hurrying
to make connections with the hermit in this
mysterious Echo Cave. There's still another
reason, though, why I picked out this course up
the river, instead of going down. It is connected
with the fact that the Moquis have their homes
in this quarter."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Bob, "I catch on now to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
what you mean. The chances are that the Moqui
would be prowling around within fifty miles of his
own shack when he ran across the man-with-the-shining-spot-in-his-head,
otherwise the bald Professor
Oswald."</p>

<p>"That's the point, Bob."</p>

<p>"It sure beats everything how you can get on
to these things, Frank. Here I'm going to be a
lawyer some day, so they tell me; and yet I don't
seem to grab the fine points of this game of hide-and-seek
as you do."</p>

<p>"Oh! well," Frank remarked, consolingly; "a
lawyer isn't supposed to know much about trails,
and all such things. That comes to a fellow who
has spent years outdoors, studying things around
him, and keeping his wits on edge all the while."</p>

<p>"I hope to keep on learning more and more
right along," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Here comes John Henry back, to tell us he
has found a good place for camping to-night; so
no more at present, Bob."</p>

<p>It proved just as Frank had said. The guide
declared that as the sun was low down, the canyon
would soon be darkening; and they ought to make
a halt while the chance was still good to see what
lay around them.</p>

<p>Accordingly they made a camp, and not a great
distance away from the border of the swirling
river that rolled on to pass through all the balance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
of that wonderful gulch, the greatest in the known
world.</p>

<p>They had come prepared for this, carrying quite
a number of things along that would prove welcome
at supper time. A cheery fire was soon blazing,
and the guide busied himself in preparations
for a meal; while the two boys wandered down to
the edge of the river, to throw a few rocks into
the current, and talk undisturbed.</p>

<p>"There are several other camps not far away,"
remarked Frank. "I could see the smoke rising
in two places further on."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Bob, "and there's one behind
us too, for I saw smoke rising soon after we
halted. Perhaps that may be Eugene's stopping
place; eh, Frank?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be surprised one little bit. Just
look at the river, how silently it pushes along
right here. It's deep too; and yet below a mile
or so it frets and foams among the boulders that
have dropped into its great bed from the high
cliffs."</p>

<p>"And they do say some bold explorers have
gone all the way through the canyon in a boat; but
I reckon it must be a terrible trip," Bob ventured
to say.</p>

<p>"Excuse us from trying to make it," laughed
Frank; "by the time we'd reach Mohave City,
where that bottle was picked up, there wouldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
be much left of us. But let's go back to camp
now. John Henry must have grub ready."</p>

<p>Three minutes later he suddenly caught Bob's
sleeve.</p>

<p>"Wait up!" he whispered. "There's somebody
talking to our guide right now; and say, Bob,
don't you recognize the fellow?"</p>

<p>"If I didn't think it was silly I'd say it was old
Spanish Joe, the cowboy we had so much trouble
with on Thunder Mountain," Bob declared,
crouching down.</p>

<p>"Well, think again," said Frank; "and you'll
remember that Abajo is his nephew!"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>THE TREACHEROUS GUIDE</h3>

<br />

<p>"Why, of course he is," declared Bob; "and
it looks as if our old enemies had cropped up
again, to join forces with the new ones. That
will make three against us; won't it, Frank?"</p>

<p>"The more the merrier," replied the other, but
Bob could see that he was inwardly worried over
the new phase of the situation.</p>

<p>"Look at the way Spanish Joe is arguing with
John Henry!" said Bob. "The guide keeps
pointing this way, as if he might be afraid we'd
come back, and see him talking with Old Joe.
Now they shake hands, Frank. Do you think any
bargain has been struck between them?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it has," replied his comrade, gritting
his teeth with displeasure. "John Henry
has sold us out, and gone over to the enemy for
cash. I saw him hide something in his pocket."</p>

<p>"Then what will we do about him?" asked
Bob, clenching his fist, as if it might give him considerable
pleasure to take the treacherous guide
personally in hand, and teach him the needed lesson.</p>

<p>"That's easy," chuckled Frank. "We'll keep
on guard to-night, and when he sees how we hang<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
to our guns he won't try any tricks, you may be
sure."</p>

<p>"And in the morning?" Bob went on.</p>

<p>"Why," declared Frank, firmly; "there's only
one thing to be done&mdash;we must fire John Henry,
even if we have to pay him the whole sum agreed
on for the week."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear you say that, Frank; because
I'd hate to have him along. Why, he might take
a notion to step on my fingers when I was climbing
up after him, and claim it was only an accident,
but if I had a broken leg, or a cracked skull,
that wouldn't do me any good, I take it."</p>

<p>"There, Joe is moving off, and we can head
for camp," Frank remarked, as they still hovered
behind the spur of rocks that had concealed them,
though allowing a view of the little camp.</p>

<p>"But you don't want to tell John Henry that
we saw him making a bargain with Spanish Joe, I
take it?" Bob questioned.</p>

<p>"That's right, we don't; and try to keep from
looking as if you suspected him. Now his back
is turned, come along," and Frank, rising, led
the way.</p>

<p>The preparations for supper went on apace.
The guide was unusually talkative, Bob thought,
and he wondered whether it was not the result of
a disturbed conscience. Perhaps John Henry
might not be wholly bad, and was worried over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
having entered into an arrangement to betray his
generous young employers.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do for a guide when
we let him go?" asked Bob, later on, after they
had eaten supper, and John Henry had wandered
down to the river for a dip, as he said.</p>

<p>"We'll have to trust to luck to pick up another,"
Frank declared. "And if it comes to the
worst, we can go it alone, I reckon. I've never
been up against such a big job as this, but I think
I'd tackle it, if I had to. But wait and see what
another day brings out."</p>

<p>When it came time for them to retire they began
talking about their ranch habit of standing
guard. The guide laughed at the idea of any
harm coming to pass while they were there in the
canyon.</p>

<p>"Lots of other tourists are camping inside of
three mile from here," he said; "and I heard the
sheriff of the county himself is somewhere down
in the canyon; so it don't look as how there could
anything happen. But just as you says, boys; if
it makes you feel better to stand guard, I ain't
got a thing agin it."</p>

<p>The night passed without any sort of attack.
Either Frank or Bob sat up all the time, with a
trusty rifle ready; but there was no occasion to
make use of the weapon.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>

<p>With the coming of morning they made
ready to eat a hasty breakfast. After this was
over Frank found himself compelled to discharge
the guide.</p>

<p>"We've concluded to do without your services,
John Henry," he said, as the man stood ready to
start forth on the way along the canyon, heading
East.</p>

<p>"Me? Let me go? What for?" stammered
the fellow; turning red and then white as a consciousness
of his guilt broke upon him.</p>

<p>"Here's what we promised to pay you for the
week," continued Frank. "We want no hard
feelings about it. Never mind why we let you go.
You can think what you like. But next time you
hire out to a party, John Henry, be careful how
you let anybody hand you over a few dollars to
make you turn against your friends."</p>

<p>The man tried to speak, and his voice failed
him. They left him standing there, holding the
bills Frank had thrust into his hand, and looking
"too cheap for anything," as Bob said. Perhaps
he feared that the boys might tell what they knew
about him, and in this way destroy his usefulness
as a canyon guide ever afterwards.</p>

<p>"Good riddance to bad rubbish!" declared
Bob, after they had gone on half a mile, and on
looking back saw John Henry still standing there
as if hardly knowing whether to be sorry, or glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
over having received full pay for a week after
only working a single day.</p>

<p>"And here we are cut loose from everybody,
and going it on our own hook," laughed Frank.
"But it would be foolish for us to think of doing
without a guide if so be we can find one. We'll
ask every party we meet, and perhaps in that way
we can strike the right man."</p>

<p>During the morning they came upon several
parties making the rounds of the Wonderland
along the beaten channels. Sometimes women
were in the company, for the strange sights that
awaited the bold spirit capable of enduring ordinary
fatigue tempted others besides men to undertake
one of the trips.</p>

<p>Just at noon the two boys came upon a lone
Chinaman sitting at a little fire he had kindled,
cooking a fish, evidently pulled from the river by
means of a hook and line.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think!" exclaimed Frank,
as he stared at the Oriental; "Bob, don't you recognize
that cousin of our ranch cook, Ah Sin, the
same fellow who was down at our place five
months ago? Hello! Charley Moi, what are
you doing in the big canyon, tell me?"</p>

<p>The Chinaman jumped up, and manifested more
or less joy at the sight of Frank. He insisted on
shaking hands with both the boys.</p>

<p>"How do? Glad see Flank, Blob! Me, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
cook for plarties in Gland Canyon. Hear of
chance gettee job up Gland View Hotel. Go
there now. Alle samee like see boys from Circle
Lanch. How Ah Sin? Him berry veil last time
hear samee."</p>

<p>Frank had an idea.</p>

<p>"See here, Charley Moi," he said; "you say
you've been about the big canyon a long time now,
serving as a cook to parties who go up and down.
Perhaps we might engage you to stay with us!"</p>

<p>"Me cook velly fine much all timee. You tly
Charley Moi, you never say solly do samee!" declared
the Oriental, his moon-like face illuminated
with a childlike and bland smile.</p>

<p>"But we want you for a guide too, Charley;
you ought to know a heap about the place by this
time," Frank went on.</p>

<p>"Alle light, me do," replied the other, glibly.
"No matter, cookee or guide, alle samee. Lucky
we meet. Tly flish. Just ketchee from water.
Cook to turnee. Plentee for all. Then go like
Flank, Blob say. Sabe?"</p>

<p>As it was nearly noon the boys were quite satisfied
to make a little halt, and taste the fresh fish
which the Chinaman had succeeded in coaxing
from the rushing waters of the nearby Colorado.</p>

<p>Later on they once again made a start.
Charley Moi did everything in his power to prove
his fidelity and faithfulness. He seemed proud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
of the fact that the son of the big owner of Circle
Ranch, where his cousin worked as cook for the
mess, trusted him, and had employed him as a
guide. Never before in the history of the Grand
Canyon had a Chinaman held such an exalted
office; and Charley believed he had cause to feel
proud.</p>

<p>"Can we trust him?" Bob asked, as evening
came on again. "I've always heard that Chinamen
are treacherous fellows."</p>

<p>"Then you've heard what isn't true," Frank
replied. "A Chinaman never breaks his word.
Over in the Far East I've read that all the merchants
of British cities are Chinese. The Japs
are a different kind of people. Yes, we can trust
Charley Moi. He would never betray us to our
enemies."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, that night the boys also slept on
their arms, so to speak. One of them remained
on guard at different times, the entire night.
Frank had learned caution on the range. He did
not mean to be taken by surprise; though he really
believed that nothing would be done to injure
them until after they had found some trace of the
hidden hermit of Echo Cave.</p>

<p>Before another twelve hours had passed he had
occasion to change his opinion. The night did
not bring any alarm in its train. Charley Moi
was up several times, shuffling around, looking at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
the fire, and sitting there smoking his little pipe,
as though in satisfaction over having struck such
a profitable job so easily; but he gave no sign of
holding any intercourse with outsiders.</p>

<p>With the coming of morning they were once
more on the way. Frank noticed with considerable
satisfaction that now they seemed to be beyond
the ordinary limit of the various trails taken
by the regular tourist parties.</p>

<p>They were walking along, about the middle of
the morning, when they found themselves in a
lonely region, where the dim trail led along the
foot of rugged walls stretching up, red and apparently
unscalable, to the height of hundreds of
feet.</p>

<p>Frank was craning his neck as he looked up
overhead, wondering if it could be possible that
there was any sign of an abandoned cliff dwellers'
village there, when he saw something move, and
at the same instant he jumped forward to pull his
chum violently back.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY</h3>

<br />

<p>Bob opened his mouth to call out, and ask what
was the matter, that his chum had seized upon
him so fiercely. But he held his breath, for something
came to pass just then that made words entirely
unnecessary.</p>

<p>A huge rock seemed to slip from its notch up
on the side of the cliff, and come crashing down,
loosening others on the way, until finally the rush
and roar almost partook of the nature of a small
avalanche.</p>

<p>Charley Moi had skipped out in a lively manner,
and thus managed to avoid being caught.
Bob stared at the pile of broken rock, about
which hung a little cloud of dust.</p>

<p>"Wow! that was as close a call as I ever hope
to have, Frank!" he exclaimed, with a little
quiver to his voice.</p>

<p>Frank himself was a bit white, and his hand
trembled as he laid it on that of his chum.</p>

<p>"I just happened to be looking up, and saw it
trembling on the break," he said. "Only for
that we might have been underneath all that
stuff."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>

<p>"But did you notice the clever way Charley
Moi avoided the deluge?" said Bob, trying to
smile, though he found it hard work.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's hard to catch a Chinaman napping,
they say," Frank went on. "Three times this
very day I've heard the thunder of falling rocks,
and that was what kept me nervous; so I watched
out above. And, Bob, it seemed as though I
must have seen that big rock just trembling as it
started to leave the face of the cliff."</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say then, is, that you jumped
to the occasion mighty well. Some fellows would
have been scared just stiff, and couldn't have
thrown out a hand to save a chum. But look
here, Frank, you don't imagine that thing was
done on purpose, do you?"</p>

<p>Frank looked at his companion, with a
wrinkle on his forehead.</p>

<p>"I don't want to think anybody could be so
mean and low as to want to hurt boys who'd
never done them any harm," he said; "but all
the same I seem to have an idea that I got a
glimpse of a man's arm when that rock started to
drop."</p>

<p>"Whew! you give me a cold chill, Frank,"
muttered Bob, gazing helplessly upward toward
the spot from which the descending rock had
started on its riotous tumble.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I hope I was mistaken," Frank went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
on. "I don't see anything up there now; and
perhaps it was only a delusion. All these bright
colors affect the eyes, you see. Then, again, it
might have been some goat jumping, that started
that rock on its downward plunge."</p>

<p>"But you didn't see any goat, Frank, did
you?" Bob asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," admitted the other; "but then
there may be a shelf up there, and any animal on
it would be hidden from the eyes of those right
below."</p>

<p>They passed on; but more than once Bob
craned his neck in the endeavor to look up to that
spot, from whence the loose rock had plunged.
He could not get it out of his head that foes were
hovering about, who thought so little of human
life that they would conspire to accomplish a
death if possible.</p>

<p>The day passed without any further peril confronting
them. Charley Moi seemed to fill the
bill as a guide, very well. He also knew the
different points of interest, and chattered away
like a magpie or a monkey as they kept pushing
on.</p>

<p>Bob became curious to know just how the
Chinaman could tell about so many things when
they were now above the trails used ordinarily
by tourists, who gave two or three days to seeing
the Grand Canyon, and then rushed away, thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
they had exhausted its wonders, when in fact
they had barely seen them.</p>

<p>He put the question to Charley Moi, and when
the smiling-faced Chinaman replied, Frank
caught his breath.</p>

<p>"That easy, bloss," said Charley, nodding.
"Happen this way. Long time black me 'gage
with sahib, like one know out in Canton. Think
have samee big joss some bit up here in canlon.
Me to bling grub to certain place evly two month.
Him give me list what buy, and put cash in hand.
Know can trust Chinaman ebery time. Many
time now me do this; so know how make trail up-river,
much far past same tourist use. Sabe,
Flank, Blob?"</p>

<p>The two boys stared at each other, unable to
say a word at first. It was as if the same tremendous
thought had come to each.</p>

<p>"Gee whiz! did you get on to that, Frank?"
finally ejaculated Bob.</p>

<p>"I sure did," replied his chum, allowing his
pent-up breath full play.</p>

<p>"Charley says he engaged himself to a gentleman
long ago; perhaps it was as much as three
years back, the time that the professor disappeared
from the haunts of men. And, Frank,
his part of the contract was to come to a certain
point away up here in the Grand Canyon, once
every two months, at a time agreed on, bringing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
a load of food, as per the list given him by this
mysterious party."</p>

<p>"It must be Professor Oswald!" exclaimed
Frank. "I've been wondering all the time how
under the sun he could have supplied himself with
food these long months if he'd cut loose from the
world, as he said in that note he had. Now the
puzzle begins to show an answer. Charley Moi
is the missing link. He has kept the professor
in grub all the time. Did you ever hear of such
luck? First we run across that old Moqui, who
has been in touch with the man we want to find;
and now here's the one who comes up here every
little while to deliver his goods, and get a new
list, as well as money to pay for the same. It's
just the limit, that's what!"</p>

<p>He turned to the Chinaman, and continued:</p>

<p>"Did you happen to notice, Charley, whether
this party you are working for is a bald-headed
man? Has he a shining top when he takes his
hat off; and does he bend over, as if he might be
hunting for diamonds all the time?"</p>

<p>The Chinese guide smirked, and bobbed his
head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"That him, velly much, just same say. Shiny
head, and blob this away alle time," with which
he walked slowly forward, bending over as
though trying to discover a rich vein of gold in
the seamed rock under his feet.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>

<p>"Shake hands, Bob," said Frank. "We're
getting hot on the trail. Now we needn't have
any doubt at all about the choice of the eastern
route. It's the right one; and somewhere further
on we're just bound to find Echo Cave."</p>

<p>"Then all we've got to fear, Frank, is the
work of Eugene and his crowd. Let us keep
clear of that bad lot, and we're going to succeed.
Any time, now, we may glimpse our old Moqui,
returning with a message from the professor, if
he sees fit to reply to your appeal. He may,
though, be so set and stubborn that nothing will
move him from his game of hiding. Then we'll
have to get that paper, with his signature, and
save the mine for his family."</p>

<p>"That's what I mean to do," replied the other,
with grim determination. "If he's so wrapped
up in his scheme that he just won't come out,
we're going to do the best we can to save his
fortune in spite of him. There's his daughter
Janice to think of. Above all, we mustn't let
that schemer, Eugene Warringford, get his
fingers on the document."</p>

<p>That night they made camp in a little cave that
offered an asylum. The boys rather fancied the
idea for a change. And they passed a very comfortable
night without any alarm.</p>

<p>Once, Bob being on duty near the mouth of the
opening, heard a shuffling sound without. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
could not make out whether it was caused by the
passage of a human being, or a bear. Half believing
that they were about to be attacked by
some animal that fancied the cave as a den, he
had drawn back the hammer of his rifle, and
watched the round opening that was plainly seen
at the time, as it was near morning, and the small
remnant of a moon was shining without.</p>

<p>But he waited in vain, and, as the minutes passed
without any further alarm, Bob heaved a sigh of
relief. It was all very well to think of shooting
big game; but under such conditions he did not
much fancy a close battle.</p>

<p>When morning came, and he had told Frank
about it, the other immediately went out to look
for traces of the animal. As he came back Bob
saw by the expression on his chum's face that
Frank had made some sort of discovery.</p>

<p>"How about it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It was no bear," replied the other, decidedly.</p>

<p>"But sure I heard something moving, Frank,
and I was wide-awake at the time, too," Bob protested.</p>

<p>"I guess you were, all right," Frank admitted.
"A man passed by, not far from the mouth
of the cave. He even stooped down, and looked
in, though careful not to let his head show
against the bright background. Then he went
off again up the canyon."</p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>

<p>"Since you know so much, Frank, perhaps you
could give a guess as to who he was," said Bob,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"No guess about it," came the reply. "I've
examined his track before, and ought to know it
like a book. It was Abajo, Bob!"</p>

<p>"Then ten to one, Spanish Joe and Eugene
were close by!" declared Bob. "Say, do you
really believe he knew we were in here?"</p>

<p>"Of course he did," Frank asserted. "Perhaps
they saw us enter. But Abajo also knows
that both of us are fair shots. He did not dare
take the chance of trying to creep in. It would
be more dangerous than our going into that wolf
den."</p>

<p>"The plot seems to be thickening, Frank. It
won't be long now before something is bound to
happen. If we could only run across the old
Moqui now, and hear that he carried a message
in answer to your note, that would clear the air
a heap, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, we must live in hopes," replied Frank,
cheerfully. "And now, after a bite which
Charley Moi is getting ready for us, we'll be off
again, and tackle the roughest traveling in the
whole canyon, so he says. But he knows the
way, because he was led up here by the old professor,
and told to come back every two months."<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WINDOWS IN THE ROCKY WALLS</h3>

<br />

<p>"Well, here it's the fourth day we've been
out, and nothing doing yet, Frank!"</p>

<p>Bob spoke gloomily, as though the unsuccessful
search was beginning to pall upon him a little.
Boys' natures differ so much; and while the young
Kentuckian had many fine qualities that his chum
admired, still he was not so persistent as Frank.</p>

<p>Nothing could ever daunt the boy from Circle
Ranch. Difficulties, he believed, were only
thrown in his way to bring out the better parts
of his nature. The more a fellow found himself
"up against it," as Frank called meeting
trouble half-way, the stronger became his character.</p>

<p>"Oh! well, now, Bob, I wouldn't say that,"
he answered the complaint of his chum. "Just
think what tremendous progress we've been making
right along. And if the very worst comes,
didn't Charley Moi say that it was only a week
now before he must get another stock of things
to eat, and won't he have to wait at the place of
meeting, for the 'learned sahib' to appear, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
take them from him, as he has done so often?
Why, we can be in hiding nearby, and meet the
professor, even against his will."</p>

<p>"That's so," Bob admitted, the argument
proving a clincher; "and I reckon I'm a silly
clown to think anything else."</p>

<p>"No, you're only tired, after a pretty tough
day, that's all," Frank declared. "When you've
had a rest you'll feel better. I'm more used to
this sort of thing than you are, old fellow; but
all the same we must admit that we're getting the
greatest view ever of this old canyon."</p>

<p>"That's so, Frank, and it's worth all the
climbing and sliding, too. But every time we've
discovered signs of any of those old deserted
homes of the cliff dwellers, why, we find they've
been visited time and again by curious folks hoping
to discover some treasure, or keepsakes of
the extinct people. No chance for the old professor
to hide away there."</p>

<p>"But pretty soon we're going to discover a
new batch of those caves in the face of the rock,
something unknown to all other searchers.
We'll find it by the aid of this same glass; and because
we're looking for it, high up. In all these
other cases you see, Bob, there were shelves of
rock above shelves; and new ladders have been
made by the guides, so that anybody with nerve
could climb up and up. Now these ladders give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
the thing away. And I've somehow got the
notion in my head that in the case of the rock
dwellings where the professor is hiding himself,
there is no outward sign in the shape of ladders."</p>

<p>"But in that case, Frank, how under the sun
could the old fellows ever get up to their dens,
which you said must be near the top of a high
cliff?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's something we're going to find
out later on, you see," replied the other, serenely.
"Perhaps they had some way of lowering themselves
from the top by means of a rope, or a
stout, wide grape vine. Then, again, there may
be some cleft in the rock farther away, that no
one would notice; but which was used as a trail,
running up into the cliff, and to the rock houses."</p>

<p>"It does take you to figure out these things,"
declared Bob, in admiration, as they trudged
along, with Charley Moi in advance.</p>

<p>"Then we haven't yet got to the place where
the Chinese buyer meets his employer with the
eatables?" Bob remarked after a little silence.</p>

<p>"The last time I asked him he kept saying it
was only a little farther along," replied Frank.</p>

<p>"There, look at him stopping right now; and
Frank, he's grinning at us in a way that can only
mean one thing. That must be where he always
waits for the queer old gentleman to show up."</p>

<p>"How about that, Charley; is this the place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
where you hang out?" asked Frank, as they hastened
to join the guide.</p>

<p>"Allee samee place," replied Charley Moi,
waving his yellow hand around him. "Not
know where shaib come fromee, always turn
roundee rock," and he pointed to a large outlying
mass that had, ages ago, become detached from
the towering cliff overhead, and fallen in such a
fashion as to partly obstruct the canyon trail.</p>

<p>Frank looked around him eagerly.</p>

<p>"We must be getting warmer all the time,"
he remarked; "and if you just take a look at
that river right now, you'll see that up yonder the
rock rises up almost from its very flood. When
the water is high it must sweep along against the
face of that big cliff. And Bob, something seems
to tell me that somewhere inside of a mile or so,
we're going to find what we're looking for."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope so!" echoed Bob, with a look of
expectancy on his face; for he always put great
reliance on the common sense of his chum; and
when Frank said a thing in that steady tone, the
Kentucky boy believed it must be so.</p>

<p>Frank called a halt then and there.</p>

<p>"We're tired, anyway," he said, "and might
as well spend the night here. Besides, I just
want to find a place were I can take a good look
through the glass up at that cliff near the top.
It faces the West, all right, you see; and the indications<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
are that somewhere or other I'll find
signs of the queer windows belonging to some of
those cave houses."</p>

<p>The camp was made, and Charley Moi busied
himself with his fire. Bob had some things he
wished to attend to; while Frank took the glass,
and, settling down in a place where he believed
he could get a fair view of the upper strata of
colored rock, began carefully scrutinizing the
cliff.</p>

<p>"The time is right, because the old Indian said
the Westering sun shone in the mouth of Echo
Cave," Frank mused, as he pursued his work,
not disappointed because failure came in the beginning.</p>

<p>Frank had been at work possibly six or eight
minutes when he gave utterance to a low exclamation.
Then he fixed his field glasses upon a certain
spot as though something had caught his attention
there.</p>

<p>"Bob!" he called out.</p>

<p>"Want me?" asked his chum from the spot
where the fire was burning.</p>

<p>"Yes, come here please," Frank continued.</p>

<p>Bob quickly complied with the request. He
knew that although his camp-mate spoke in such
a quiet tone, he had evidently made a discovery.
Frank could repress his feelings even in a moment
of great excitement, which was something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
beyond the ability of the more impetuous Kentucky
lad.</p>

<p>"What have you found, Frank?" he asked, as
he reached the side of the other.</p>

<p>"Here, take the glass," said Frank. "Point
it toward that little cone that seems to rise up
like a chimney above the level of the cliff top.
Got it now? Well, let your glass slowly drop
straight down the face of the rock. Never mind
the glint of the sun, and the fine rich color. I
know it's just glorious, and all that; but we're
after something more important now than pictures
and color effects. What do you see, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Honest now, I believe you've hit the bulls-eye
this time, Frank."</p>

<p>"Then you think they're windows, about after
the same style as those holes in the rock where
we climbed up the ladders to the deserted homes
of the old time cliff dwellers?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Sure they are; no mistake about it, either," replied
Bob, and then he gave a low exclamation.</p>

<p>"What did you see?" demanded Frank, as if
suspecting the truth.</p>

<p>"I don't know," came the reply; "but something
seemed to move just inside one of those
openings. It may have been a garment fluttering
in the breeze that must be blowing so far up the
heights; and then, again, perhaps some hawk, or
other bird, has its nest there, and just flew past.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
I couldn't say, Frank; but I saw <i>something</i>, and
it moved!"</p>

<p>Frank took the glass, and looked long and
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Whatever it was," he remarked, "it doesn't
mean to repeat the act. But all the same, Bob,
I've got a hunch we've found the place, and that
Echo Cave lies far up yonder in that beetling
cliff."</p>

<p>"It's a fierce reach up there," remarked Bob,
as he scanned the height. "How under the sun
d'ye suppose that old professor could ever get up
and down? Too far for him to have a rope ladder;
and even if he had, how could he reach the
place at first? Frank, all the way up, I can't
see the first sign of any rock shelves, where ladders
might have rested long ago."</p>

<p>"That's so," replied the other, reflectively.
"The face of the cliff is as even and smooth as a
floor. Nobody would ever look to find a cluster
of cliff dwellers' homes up there; that is, nobody
but a man like Professor Oswald, who has made
a life study of such things, and knows all the indications.
But something tells me we're pretty
near the end of our long trail. The only question
now is, how can we get in touch with the
hermit of Echo Cave?"</p>

<p>As night settled down the two boys returned
to the fire, still perplexed.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>FINDING A WAY UP</h3>

<br />

<p>That night they kept no fire going. Frank
seemed to think it best that they remain quiet, so
as not to announce their presence in the neighborhood.
Though for that matter, it would seem
that if any one were perched aloft in one of those
slits in the face of the cliff, that represented the
windows of the cave dwellings, the entire canyon
below must be spread out like a book.</p>

<p>Nothing happened to disturb them. Once
Frank thought he heard a distant shout, and this
excited his curiosity not a little. According to
what Charley Moi said they were now in a
neighborhood where ordinary tourists never
visited.</p>

<p>He thought of the two sheriffs and the lawless
men they were pursuing. Could it be possible
that they were destined to run across those
desperate characters sooner or later?</p>

<p>The thought was a disquieting one. It served
to make Frank wakeful, and his restlessness was
communicated to Bob, although the latter did not
know what caused it.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>

<p>But if the fugitives from justice were loitering
around in that particular part of the Grand
Canyon, either hiding from the determined
sheriffs, or looking for rich quarry, neither they
or anyone else disturbed the camp of the saddle
boys.</p>

<p>Again, in the morning, Charley Moi lighted a
fire, and made ready to prepare a modest breakfast.
As Bob had said, their supplies were running
low, and unless something happened very
soon the Chinaman would have to be dispatched
to the nearest store to replenish the food.</p>

<p>Still thinking of the sound he had heard during
the night, and which he believed must have
been a human voice, rather than the cry of some
wild animal, Frank, while they sat cross-legged
around the fire, eating the scanty meal, addressed
himself to the Chinaman.</p>

<p>"How many times have you come up this far,
Charley Moi?" he asked.</p>

<p>The other commenced to figure on his fingers.
Having no counting board, used so frequently by
his countrymen in laundries, until they get accustomed
to the habits of the white man, he took
this means of tabulating.</p>

<p>"Allee fingers and this much over," and he
held up the first and second fingers of one hand.</p>

<p>"Ten and two, making twelve in all," declared
Bob. "Well, you have served the man-with-the-bald-head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
faithfully and long, Charley."</p>

<p>"And in all these times I suppose you've never
known anybody to be around here?" Frank went
on.</p>

<p>Charley shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>"White man, no. Sometime Moqui come
'long, make for stlore down canlon get glub.
See same two, thlee times. Charley Moi see old
Moqui last night," the Chinaman replied.</p>

<p>"What's that you say?" demanded Frank,
hastily. "That you saw a Moqui last night,
and after we had come to halt right here?"</p>

<p>"Thatee so," grinned the other, as though
pleased to feel that he was able to interest Frank
so readily.</p>

<p>"Just when did this happen, Charley Moi?"
pursued the other.</p>

<p>"Flank, Blob, down by river, make muchee
look-look in glass," answered Charley.</p>

<p>"Now, what d'ye think of that?" ejaculated
Bob, in disgust. "While we were away from
camp for ten minutes, something happened. Why
couldn't it have come about when we were on
deck? There's a fine chance lost to get track
of Havasupai; for I reckon you believe the same
as I do, Frank, and that the old Moqui whom
Charley saw was <i>our</i> Indian?"</p>

<p>"Seems like it, Bob," replied the other, "but
don't cry yet. Perhaps it may not be too late to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
remedy matters. See here, Charley Moi, could
you show me just where you saw this Moqui
last?"</p>

<p>The yellow-skinned guide smirked, and nodded
his head until his pigtail bobbed up and down like
a bell rope.</p>

<p>"Easy do," he observed, beginning to get upon
his feet.</p>

<p>"Come along Bob," remarked Frank. "We'd
all better be present. Three heads are better
than one when it comes to a question of deciding
what's to be done."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can track him, Frank?"
questioned the Kentucky boy, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I'm going to try," was all Frank would say;
for he was very modest with regard to his accomplishments
as a son of the prairie.</p>

<p>Charley Moi was as good as his word. He
seemed to remember just where he had happened
to spy the passing Indian when looking up from
the making of the fire. The Moqui had paid
no attention to him; indeed, at the time he was
creeping past as though taking advantage of the
absence of the two boys in order to make a
circuit of the camp near the big cliff.</p>

<p>"Find 'em Frank?" asked Bob, after he had
seen his chum bending down over the ground for
half a minute.</p>

<p>"Yes, and they are the tracks of an Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
too, for they toe in," Frank replied. "Besides,
they are made by moccasins instead of shoes or
boots with heels. And if I needed any further
proof to tell me our friend Havasupai made
these tracks, and not a strange Moqui, I have
it in the queer patch across the toe of his right
moccasin, which I noticed when he was with us
before."</p>

<p>"That's just fine!" Bob exclaimed, filled with
pride over the way in which his chum seemed
able to fix the facts so that they could not be
questioned. "And will you start after him right
away, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Watch me; that's all," came the reply, as
Frank began to move away, still bending low in
order to follow the faint traces of footprints on
the rock and scanty soil.</p>

<p>The others came close at his heels, Bob with
a look of assurance on his face, because he felt
positive that the game would now be tracked to
its hiding place; and Charley Moi picturing his
wonder on his moon-like countenance.</p>

<p>So the prairie lad led them in and out among
the rocks, and the scrub that grew close to the
verge of the river. Several times he seemed a
little in doubt, as the marks faded entirely away;
but on such occasions his common-sense came to
the rescue, and, after a look around, Frank was
able to once more find the trail.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>

<p>"Here's where it ends!"</p>

<p>When Frank made this remark Bob could not
keep from expressing his surprise.</p>

<p>He gaped upward at the bare-faced wall that
arose for hundreds of feet, without any particular
ledge or outcropping where even a nimble Indian
could find safe lodgment for his moccasined
feet.</p>

<p>"But, Frank, however could the old Moqui
get up there to see Uncle Felix?" he asked.
"D'ye suppose he made some sort of signal, and
the hermit lowered a long rope with a noose at
the end, which would draw him up? Wow! excuse
me from ever trying to fly in that way! It
would make me so dizzy I'd be sure to drop, and
get smashed."</p>

<p>"You're beating on the wrong track, Bob,"
remarked the other. "No rope could be lowered
all that distance; and even if it could no
one man would be able to pull another all the
way up."</p>

<p>"But there must be some way of getting to
the place where the slits in the face of the cliff
tell of windows. However do you think he did
it, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Just because you don't happen to see a
ladder, Bob, is no evidence there isn't a way to
mount upward. One thing about this great cliff
I guess you didn't happen to notice. That shows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
you pass things by. Look again, and you'll see
that it seems to have been split by some volcanic
smash, ages ago. There's a regular crevice running
slantingly up the face of the rock. You see
it now, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do; and I was blind not to take notice
of the same before," Bob replied. "Fact is, I
did see that uneven mark, but just thought it was
a fault in the make of the cliff, as a miner would
say."</p>

<p>"Well, that crack extends four-fifths of the
way up to the top; and far enough to reach the
place where we noticed all those dark marks,
which we believed must be windows of the many
rooms or houses of the cliff dwellers. Get that,
Bob?"</p>

<p>"Sure I do, Frank, and after your explanation
I can see what you're aiming at. But where
does that ragged crevice start from down here, do
you think?"</p>

<p>Frank stepped forward. Just as if he had it
all figured out, he bent down, and with his hand
drew aside the bushes that grew against the base
of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, there it is for a fact!" exclaimed
Bob, as he saw a rough opening before
him, which came almost together five feet from
the ground, leaving only a dark, uneven, slanting
line that crawled up the face of the cliff like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
photograph of a zigzag bolt of lightning taken
with a snapshot camera.</p>

<p>"There you are," said Frank, with a broad
smile. "Unless all signs fail, here's the entrance
to the mysterious Echo Cave. We have been
more than lucky to find it with so little trouble."</p>

<p>"Just to think of it," remarked Bob, as he
bent over to look up into the gap as well as he
was able; "here's where the queer old Professor
has been hiding for all this time, and no one any
the wiser. But Frank, however in the wide world
do you suppose he found out the way to get up
there?"</p>

<p>"We would have found it sooner or later,
even if Charley Moi had not seen the old Indian
moving along," replied Frank, with the confidence
of one who knows what he is talking about.</p>

<p>"Y&mdash;yes, I reckon we would, after you'd
prowled around a little, and had some chance to
look the ground over. Then you believe he must
have found the presence of those windows looking
out of the cliff just like we did; by using a
powerful glass? And, thinking that here was the
very place for him to hide and study, he set about
looking for the road up, and found it, very
likely."</p>

<p>"He did it by using common sense, and applying
all he knew about the ways of these people of
the long ago," replied Frank. "And you can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
see that if he chose, he could have thrown that
bottle out of one of the openings up there, so
that it would drop in the passing current of the
Colorado, to be carried down-stream until somebody
saw it; and finding the message to my
father, sent or carried it to Circle Ranch."</p>

<p>"Well," observed Bob, with a gleam in his
eye, "now that we've found a way to get up to
Echo Cave, have we the nerve to start in?"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>

<h3>FORTUNE STILL FAVORS THE BRAVE</h3>

<br />

<p>Instead of replying at once to this question,
as Bob undoubtedly thought his chum would do,
Frank seemed to give a start. He dropped to his
hands and knees, and seemed to be examining
some marks on the ground.</p>

<p>If ever the fair knowledge of reading tracks
which Frank possessed was called upon to do
duty, it was now. Bob, of course, could not understand
what possessed his comrade; but simply
stood there and stared, wondering what Frank
had found to cause him to exhibit such breathless
interest, and all the signs of unusual excitement.</p>

<p>When finally the lad on his knees did look
up, Bob saw a grave expression on his face.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong, Frank; tell me
what it is?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I've made an unpleasant discovery, Bob," replied
the other. "Charley!" he added turning
to the wondering Celestial, "go back to our
camp, and bring our guns right away, both of
them, see?"</p>

<p>"Yep, bloss, me unelstand. Charley Moi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
gettee gluns light away quick!" and as he said
this the obliging Chinaman went on a run, his
pigtail and blue blouse flying out behind him.</p>

<p>"Say, whatever does all this mystery mean,
Frank?" asked Bob, almost helplessly.</p>

<p>"Just what you might imagine; that there's
danger hanging about us, Bob."</p>

<p>The eyes of the astonished Bob sought the
ground at the point where his chum had been so
deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Then it must be something you just discovered
there, and that's a fact," he declared;
"because you didn't act this way three minutes
ago."</p>

<p>"I happened to discover footprints coming
from another quarter," Frank went on, calmly;
"and they headed into this crevice, just as those
of the moccasined Moqui did from that side.
And they came after old Havasupai had gone
up, for I found where they wiped out a part of
one of his tracks."</p>

<p>"Footprints, and were they made by the old
professor, do you think?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"Not any. Fact is," observed Frank, as
though deciding to have the worst over, "they
were the tracks of three persons, all men!"</p>

<p>"Oh! my! three, you said, Frank; and that
would mean Eugene, Spanish Joe, and Abajo,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>

<p>"Just the very ones I meant," replied Frank.</p>

<p>"Then they must have been hiding some place
near here, and saw the Moqui pass in?" suggested
Bob, fully aroused by now.</p>

<p>"That seems to be what happened," Frank
observed. "But here comes Charley Moi with
the guns. See how he dodges about, so as to
keep hidden from the view of anybody up in
those windows above, which we can't glimpse
from here."</p>

<p>When Bob eagerly took his repeating rifle
from the hands of the Chinaman he exhibited all
the evidence of great satisfaction; for he heaved
a sigh of relief, and fondled his weapon in a way
that caused his comrade to smile.</p>

<p>"I feel better now," Bob confessed; "because,
to tell the honest truth, when you broke the news
so suddenly it nearly gave me heart failure,
Frank, to think that if those rascals sprang out
at us we would be next door to helpless. Now
let 'em be careful how they play their little game.
But what does it all mean, do you suppose,
Frank?"</p>

<p>"I can only make a guess, and that may be wide
of the truth," the other admitted. "By some accident
they managed to get on the track of the
Moqui. Though Havasupai thought himself
smart, he was no match for such a cunning rascal
as Spanish Joe, who is said to be the best trailer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
along the Arizona border. And they followed
him right here."</p>

<p>"That was last evening, just when you and I
stood there down by the river, looking through
the glasses up at the windows of the rock houses
above," remarked Bob.</p>

<p>"Yes. Perhaps they didn't go up right then."
Frank went on. "I admit that I can't just make
out how long ago these tracks were made. A
better trailer might, you see, Bob. If Old Hank
Coombs were only here now I'd be glad to turn
the whole business over to him, and play second
fiddle."</p>

<p>"But some time between dark and morning
these three rascals went in here, and surprised
the hermit of Echo Cave&mdash;is that it, Frank?"</p>

<p>"It covers the case all right," came the reply.</p>

<p>"Say, do you think they are up there yet?"
asked the Kentucky lad, in an anxious tone.</p>

<p>"I think they must be, Bob, because all the
tracks point one way, showing that the three
men never came back. If they left the cave it
must have been by some other way."</p>

<p>"No use asking why they would want to get in
touch with Uncle Felix!" continued Bob, as if
bent on finding out everything he could in connection
with the case.</p>

<p>"We know what their reason was," Frank
made answer. "When Abajo, hanging about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
window of our ranch house, heard what we had
to say about the message that came floating down
the Colorado in that bottle, and carried the
wonderful news to his employer, Eugene Warringford,
he set the game going that must end
right here. He has come with the intention of
making Professor Oswald turn over that option
to him; and he'll do it unless something we can
offer prevents."</p>

<p>"But Frank, if the Moqui carried that note
of yours to Uncle Felix, he would be on his guard,
and absolutely refuse to sign away the papers?"</p>

<p>"I hope he will, but I fear that those three
scamps are up there right now, trying to coax or
bulldoze him into signing," Frank said, with a
tightening of his lips, and a flash of his clear
eyes.</p>

<p>"Then we go up, and put a spoke in their
wheel, do we?" asked Bob, looking as if he
were ready to make the start instantly, if his
comrade but gave the word.</p>

<p>Frank glanced around him a little uncertainly.</p>

<p>"I've got a good notion to try it," he muttered
as if talking to himself.</p>

<p>"What's that you say, Frank?" asked his
companion, who had caught the words, and did
not know what to make of them.</p>

<p>"I didn't tell you, Bob," Frank remarked;
"but during the night I thought I heard a voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
calling far away yonder. And somehow it struck
me at the time that there was a familiar cowboy
yell about it."</p>

<p>"Old Hank Coombs, perhaps, Frank?" suggested
the other lad, quickly.</p>

<p>"That was on my mind, Bob. You know history
often repeats itself. Once before, just when
we seemed to need Hank the worst way, he came
riding along as if he had heard us call. And
I was wondering whether he might not be somewhere
around here right now."</p>

<p>"That would be just prime, if only we could
get in touch with him," Bob declared. "And,
as your father wouldn't send Hank alone, there'd
be one more cowboy along. That would make
a party of four. Why, those three rascals would
just shrivel, and throw up the sponge, if they saw
us break in on 'em. But Frank, how about making
the old range call?"</p>

<p>"D'ye know, I was just thinking it might do
to try it," remarked the other.</p>

<p>"Then start in and give the whoop," Bob observed.
"No harm done anyhow; even if they
hear it up there. And while you're doing all
that, I'll just drop on one knee here, and cover
the crack in the wall. Suppose one of the lot
should try and come out while we were off our
guard. I'll make him surrender quicker than he
can say 'Jack Robinson'!"</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>

<p>Presently there sounded upon the morning air
the clear "cooee" of the range, particularly well
known to every cowboy who had worked at
Circle Ranch. Frank and Bob listened eagerly to
learn whether there would come any response.
If not, then they must take up the task of climbing
that singular crevice by themselves; and finding
out how affairs stood above.</p>

<p>Their suspense was short-lived, for quickly
there floated to their waiting ears a responsive
call. Turning toward the quarter from whence
it seemed to come they saw a hat waving.</p>

<p>"It's Old Hank, sure it is!" exclaimed Bob,
with a thrill of delight; for the burden of going
up against three desperate characters was more
than boy nature could stand without more or
less uneasiness.</p>

<p>"That's Chesty with him," announced Frank,
as two figures were discovered coming toward
them. "Why, if we'd made all the arrangements
ourselves we couldn't have done better,
Bob. Here comes our reinforcements just in the
nick of time. And if Eugene and his backers are
still up yonder in the cliff dwellers' homes,
they have stayed a little while too long, that's
all."</p>

<p>In another three minutes the boys were shaking
hands with Old Hank and Chesty; the latter
with a cheerful grin on his face, as though he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
considered it quite a joke to break in on Frank's
game at the finishing point.</p>

<p>Of course they were ignorant as to how
matters stood. And Frank took upon himself
the task of explaining all that had happened.</p>

<p>"Ther up yonder yet, then," announced Hank,
after he had carefully inspected the footprints,
and noted that they all pointed one way; "that
is to say, if they ain't got an airyplane along as
would allow of them flying off. An' Frank,
when ye sez the word we'uns are goin' t' walk up
this rock ladder t' see what sorter place the ole
perfessor keeps."</p>

<p>"Then I say it now," declared Frank, anxious
to have the thing settled one way or the other
without further delay.</p>

<p>"Foller arter me, all of ye!" called the old
plainsman, as he plunged into the gap.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<hr />

<h2 class="space"><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>

<h3>ANOTHER SURPRISE</h3>

<br />

<p>"One thing, we won't need torches this time,
Hank!" remarked Bob as he prepared to follow
after the leader.</p>

<p>"I reckons not, Bobby," chuckled the veteran
cowman, who knew that something about the
situation must have recalled their entering that
cave that day where sly old Sallie and her half-grown
whelps awaited their coming with bared
teeth.</p>

<p>Just back of Hank came Chesty, who was a
very ambitious young fellow, and always to be
counted on with regard to obtaining his proper
share in every little excitement that happened.
Then Frank filed along; and at his heels Bob
climbed; while Charley Moi brought up the rear,
bent on seeing all that might come to pass.</p>

<p>The crevice immediately began to mount upward,
just as Frank had anticipated it would.
There were times when the climbing was pretty
steep, and Frank began to wonder what sort of
agile man this old and stubborn Professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
Oswald could be, to overcome such difficulties so
often, while in the pursuit of his hobby.</p>

<p>Bob was soon panting, but no less bent on
"keeping up with the procession," as he himself
put it. They had been going back from the face
of the cliff pretty much all the time, so that there
was really no chance to take an observation, in
order to tell just how far up they had come.</p>

<p>Frank felt sure, however, after this labor had
kept up for quite a long time, that they must now
be getting near the top of the break, or where
the crooked crack in the face of the rock ended.</p>

<p>He tried to picture what they would find. If
Eugene and his reckless backers had been in possession
of the place for some hours now, they
must have tried all sorts of expedients in order
to compel the professor to reveal the secret hiding
place of the valuable document, and make
it over to them. Nor would such heartless men
hesitate long about adopting torture in order
to force a confession from the unwilling victim.</p>

<p>Then Frank wondered if the three rascals
would attempt any tactics looking to holding the
attacking force at bay. They were well armed,
no doubt, and having such a rich treasure hanging
in the scales, it might be expected that they
would hate to let it slip from their covetous
grasp without putting up some sort of fight.</p>

<p>But all that could be left to Old Hank. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
many years he had been the leading figure in all
the affairs that centered around Circle Ranch.
Did the rustlers run off part of the herd, the
veteran was put in charge of the pursuing force.
Sometimes the sly marauders got off scot free;
but more often they paid dearly for their audacity
in picking out Colonel Haywood's ranch as the
scene of their foray.</p>

<p>Frank really had no fears as to the result, now
that Hank had arrived on the scene to direct
operations. The three schemers might give them
some trouble, but they could not carry the day.</p>

<p>"Please let a fellow rest up a little, Hank!"
came from Bob, finally.</p>

<p>The old cow puncher understood that the pace
had been too warm for the tenderfoot; and he
considerately halted. Perhaps none of the
climbers were averse to a breathing spell before
the final round. It would put them in better condition
for the wind-up, whatever that might prove
to be.</p>

<p>"Frank," whispered Bob, as he pulled at the
trouser leg of his chum so as to induce him to
bend down closer.</p>

<p>"What's the row?" asked the other, in somewhat
the same guarded tone, as he managed to
double over, and bring his face close to that of
his friend.</p>

<p>"Charley Moi has just told me something,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
Bob went on. "You know we found out before
now that he's got the greatest pair of ears ever
for hearing things? Well, he says there's something
or some one following us up this old
crack!"</p>

<p>"Whew! that's nice, now. A regular procession,
it seems," remarked Frank.</p>

<p>"Who d'ye think it can be; and would a bear
or a mountain lion pick up our tracks this way?"
continued Bob, who was trying to work his rifle
around, so as to cover the rear.</p>

<p>"Wait! Let's all listen, after I send the word
along to Hank and Chesty," remarked Frank.</p>

<p>When this had been done even the old cowman
thought well enough of the idea to wait until they
could find out the nature of the sounds that had
reached the keen hearing of the wide-awake
Chinaman.</p>

<p>It was only half light in the break of the rock,
and the passage they had been following thus far
was so very crooked that no one could see more
than twenty feet down the trail.</p>

<p>Still every eye was fastened on that point
where the advancing man or animal would first
appear. Frank, too, had his rifle bearing on the
spot; and taken as a whole the appearance of
the little company, flattened out against the break
in the mighty rock wall, was rather threatening.</p>

<p>All of them could catch the sounds below now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
Whoever came up the rock ladder must be unused
to negotiating such a stairway, for they
rattled small bits of loose shale down at times;
and Frank felt sure he could hear a panting
sound, very much like that which tired Bob had
been making a minute ago.</p>

<p>And, as he listened, Frank made a discovery
that caused him to tighten his grip on that reliable
repeating rifle. There were two of the pursuers!
And he anticipated that the leader must come in
sight ere another dozen seconds passed!</p>

<p>There was some sort of movement now, down
in the region of the little twist where the steep
stairway of the old cliff dwellers made a turn.
Then a head and shoulders came into view.</p>

<p>Frank chuckled aloud. Just in almost that last
second of time he had suddenly guessed the
truth, when, in this clinging figure that was staring
upward, as though filled with genuine surprise,
he recognized an old friend.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Stanwix, the sheriff of the county!</p>

<p>He and his mate from the adjoining division
of Coconino must have just had a glimpse of
Charley Moi disappearing in the dark hole at the
base of the cliff; and, being in pursuit of two
shrewd law breakers, who had been known to
appear in other dress than that of cowmen, perhaps
the officers had concluded that here was
something that ought to be investigated.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>

<p>Frank immediately made a friendly gesture
with one hand. He did not want to risk the
chances of being fired upon by the officers of
the law, who might take the little party for bad
men. Then he beckoned in a fashion that the
sheriff must readily understand to mean caution,
and silence.</p>

<p>They saw Mr. Stanwix bend down as though
he might be explaining to his fellow officer what
an astonishing thing had happened. After that
he came on, climbing the steep rock ladder as an
exhausted person might. Yet his nature was like
that of the bulldog; and once he had started to
do a thing, nothing could make him stop.</p>

<p>When he arrived at a point where he could
make his way alongside Frank, squeezing past
Charley Moi and Bob, the sheriff of Yavapai
County turned an inquiring look upon his young
friend.</p>

<p>Whereupon Frank started in to tell him just
who the other three in the party happened to be;
and that they were bent upon foiling the lawless
game of three rascals plotting for a big stake.</p>

<p>In return Mr. Stanwix intimated that they had
suspected something wrong when they saw from
a little distance two persons, and one of them a
Chinaman, disappearing in a cleft of the rocks.
Further explanations must await a better opportunity,
however. They were now too near the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
series of chambers connecting with one another to
hesitate longer.</p>

<p>Besides, who could say what might not be going
on up there a little further, in those holes in
the wall where, ages ago, the singular people
whom Professor Oswald loved to study about,
had their homes, and lived on from year to
year?</p>

<p>Old Hank, when he once more started upward,
seemed to have become much more cautious.
Frank could easily guess the reason. There was
a strong possibility that the three schemers might
have learned of their presence in the vicinity ere
now. And of course Eugene knew full well why
Frank and Bob had come to the Grand Canyon
from their ranch home.</p>

<p>Suspecting that sooner or later the two boys
might discover the way up to the cliff house,
they would be apt to lay a trap of some sort,
thinking to catch them napping when they ascended.</p>

<p>Old Hank could not be taken unawares any
easier than might the wary weasel that has never
been seen asleep by mortal eyes.</p>

<p>Frank, keeping well up by the heels of the
little cowboy's boots, was ready to draw himself
upward at the first sign of trouble. He knew
when Hank had reached the top of the singular
stairway fashioned by Nature for the benefit of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
those who built their habitations near the top of
the cliff, far beyond the reach of enemies in the
valley below.</p>

<p>A few seconds of suspense followed, while
Chesty was following the veteran into the first
hollowed-out apartment. Nothing followed
where Frank had been expecting all manner of
evil things.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they're asleep," was the new thought
that flashed through his brain. He did not know
what manner of man Uncle Felix was.</p>

<p>Now they were all gathered there in that outer
chamber that might be called an ante-room of the
various apartments running along the face of the
cliff for some distance.</p>

<p>Even Charley Moi was there, full of curiosity,
and willing to lend a hand after a fashion. Bob
looked around; just as his chum had done as soon
as he entered. He saw that some one had certainly
been there recently. There were plenty of
evidences to that effect.</p>

<p>Old Hank raised his hand with the forefinger
elevated. It was recognized as a signal for absolute
silence by all the others. Even Bob restrained
his desire to ask questions; and every
one listened, as if expecting to catch sounds.</p>

<p>Was that a human voice?</p>

<p>Frank started a trifle as the idea came to him.
Still, it might only have been an additionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
strong movement of the breeze; turning some
angle that caused it to give forth a sound.</p>

<p>He turned to see if any of the others had
heard, and judged from the way old Hank had
his head raised that he, too, had caught the sound;
also that it appealed to him as full of significance.</p>

<p>Again the veteran waved his hand. This time
it meant not only caution, but an invitation to advance.
Hank was about to pass into the next
apartment, and wished the others to keep close at
his heels.</p>

<p>Bob was quivering all over with the fever of
suspense, as well as pent-up eagerness. He did
not know just how much longer he could hold in;
for he wanted to yell. Still, he did not do it.
Since coming to this wonderland country of the
Southwest he had learned many lessons in the
way of self control; and every day he was gaining
more and more of a mastery over himself.</p>

<p>Now Hank was in the second room, and still
heading onward toward another hole in the wall,
evidently the only means of communication between
the various houses forming the little community.</p>

<p>When he reached this, voices were plainly
heard beyond. Hank kept right on, heading for
yet a third doorway; and whoever was doing the
talking, he or they must be in that further apartment;
so that in another minute Frank expected
to have his curiosity fully satisfied.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>

<h3>THE LITTLE OLD MAN OF ECHO CAVE</h3>

<br />

<p>"You admit you have carried the document
with you, and that it's only a question of refusing
to produce it, Professor?"</p>

<p>Frank recognized that drawling voice. He
had heard his father's cousin, Eugene Warringford,
speak many times, and generally in this
slow way. But Frank also knew that back of his
apparently careless manner there was more or
less venom. Eugene could hate, and hide his feelings
in a masterly manner. He could smile, and
then strike behind the back of the one with whom
he was dealing. And somehow his very drawling
voice always made Frank quiver with instinctive
dislike.</p>

<p>"I admit nothing, sir," came another voice,
quick and nervous, yet with a firmness that told
of considerable spirit. "You come upon me in
my retreat without an invitation, and at first
claim to be a warm admirer of my work, which
you seem to have studied fairly well. But now
you are taking the mask off, sir; and I can
recognize the wolf under the sheep's clothing."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>

<p>Frank had heard that the old scientist, though
a small man, was full of grit; and he could well
believe it after hearing him speak.</p>

<p>And Bob, who crouched close at the side of his
chum, gave Frank a nudge as if to say: "What
do you think of that for nerve; isn't he the limit,
though?"</p>

<p>Eugene laughed in his lazy way at being accused
of evil intentions. Apparently he had
about made up his mind that there was no use in
longer beating about the bush. He had the old
gentleman cooped up in this isolated place, where
no assistance could possibly reach him. And
backed up himself by a couple of reckless rascals,
no doubt Eugene considered himself in a position
to demand obedience.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear old gentleman," he remarked,
and by the sound Frank imagined the fellow must
be lighting a fresh cigarette, for he seemed to
puff between the words; "just as you say, what's
the use of carrying the joke on any longer. Let's
be brutally frank with each other from now on."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied the other, quickly.
"Here's the situation then, in a nutshell. You
suddenly appear before me, with a couple of
men you claim are guides, but whom I have every
reason to believe are low minions who are simply
in your pay."</p>

<p>"Careful, Professor," Eugene broke in. "I'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
advise you to go a bit slow. These men talk
English, if they do look like Mexicans; and they
may resent being called rascals."</p>

<p>"Let that pass," continued the hermit of Echo
Cave, as though waving the matter aside contemptuously.
"At any rate, you come suddenly
into my habitation here, where I have spent many
happy months in solitude, wrapped up in my
studies of the people of the cliffs, who spent their
lives in this very place, and who have left many
traces of their customs behind. My work is almost
finished, and in another week I expected
leaving here for civilization, with a masterly book
on the subject that has mystified the world for a
century."</p>

<p>"Come to the point, Professor," broke in the
man with the drawl; "and keep all this about
your studies for those of your kind, who may
appreciate them. We are concerned only about
one thing; and that is a certain paper which
you will presently take from its hiding-place, sign
over to me, and then finish your labors here in
peace. Understand that?"</p>

<p>"By good luck I was forewarned," the sharp
voice went on; "and hence I made sure not to
carry that document on my person. You have
taken the liberty of searching every inch of these
cliff houses since you arrived here, but without
success. And allow me to inform you, sir, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
you might hunt until the day of doom without the
slightest chance of finding that paper. It will
never be yours!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I am not worrying in the least, Professor,"
Eugene remarked, coolly. "You will
see a great light presently, I imagine."</p>

<p>"I have already done so, sir," came the snappy
reply. "I am awakening to the fact that too long
have I been neglecting my daughter; and that
since this investment of mine has turned out so
happily, it must become her property."</p>

<p>"Very nice and thoughtful of you, Professor,"
sneered Eugene; "and while I dislike to spoil
such delightful plans, I fear I must do so. It is
my nature to persist in anything I undertake. And
I have made up my mind to possess that document;
or make you pay dearly for my disappointment."</p>

<p>"Now you begin to descend to low threats,
sir," cried the scientist, who did not seem to be
a particle afraid; which proved the truth of the
old saying that courage does not necessarily need
a big tenement.</p>

<p>"We have hunted high and low through this
series of ratholes, and without any success," observed
Eugene, beginning to bite off his words,
as though unable to much longer keep up the pretense
of being calm. "What have you done with
that old Moqui who came up here ahead of us?"</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>

<p>"Ah! you saw him enter the hidden stairway,
then, and that was how you learned the way to
reach these cliff dwellings?" exclaimed the other,
as though one thing that had bothered him was
now explained.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was how it came about," answered
Eugene. "We have followed him like his own
shadow for days, and yet he knew it not. Age
must have dimmed the sight and hearing of the
warrior. After we saw him pass upward, on investigating,
we found the stone ladder in the
crevice, and we waited several hours for him to
come down, for we wanted to make sure of him
first. As he did not appear, we finally could
stand it no longer, and began to creep up here,
inches at a time. Then we surprised you, and
announced our intention of stopping with you."</p>

<p>"Yes," declared the scientist, bitterly. "First
you pretended that you were sent out by a magazine
to search for me, and get some points as to
my great work here among the Zunis, the Hopis
and the Moquis. But I soon discovered that you
had another motive in trying to find Professor
Oswald. You began to hint about your desire
to possess stock in certain mines, and especially
in one, the ownership of which I had carried in
my hand for some years. Besides, I had been
warned of your real intentions, and was on my
guard."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>

<p>"What became of that old Moqui Indian?"
went on Eugene. "He climbed up, but he did
not come down. We guarded that stairway closely
every minute of the time. We have searched
every room in this rabbit burrow that we could
discover; but still he does not show up. Have
you put him away in some place, the entrance to
which is hidden from our eyes?"</p>

<p>The only reply to this question was a scornful
laugh. As Bob would say, it was as if the defiant
little professor had flashed out.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you knew?"</p>

<p>"Well, as the document and the Moqui have
both vanished mysteriously, there's only one thing
I can conclude," went on Eugene, between his
teeth; "and that is they must be together at this
very moment. Produce the one, and the other
will be found not far away."</p>

<p>"What a wise man you are, sir!" remarked
the little scientist, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I may prove a more successful one
than you imagine," returned Eugene, between
furious puffs. "Now, all the time I have been
turning this old lot of rabbit burrows upside down
I've been thinking a whole lot, Professor."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" exclaimed the other clapping his
hands vigorously; "it will certainly do you a
great amount of good, sir, for I imagine you
seldom treat yourself to such a luxury as a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
hard think. And may I inquire concerning the
result of your labors in that line?"</p>

<p>"First of all, I sized you up as a mighty stubborn
little bit of humanity."</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you, sir. Really, I am disposed
to accept that as a compliment; for you see, a
man of my profession could never succeed unless
he had mastered his inclination for an easy life,
and had become a stoic. And what else did you
happen to decide after this wonderful fit of thinking,
may I ask, sir?"</p>

<p>"This: I made up my mind that once you declined
to produce that document, to secure which
I have come a great distance, and undergone considerable
fatigue, that no threat of bodily harm
would induce you to alter your decision!"</p>

<p>"It is really very interesting to hear you say
this, sir," remarked the one who had lived in
that lofty cave for many months, poring over the
queer things that he unearthed from time to time
in the ruins of the cliff dwellers' homes. "And
after reaching such a conclusion as that, how
comes it you persisted in trying to carry out your
original intention?"</p>

<p>"Because I had another arrow in my quiver,
Professor!" remarked Eugene, in a penetrating
voice, that had a ring of anticipated triumph in
it.</p>

<p>"H'm! torture, perhaps?" suggested the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
other; "but my dear sir, nothing of that nature
could make me open my lips. I would die rather
than submit to your proposals."</p>

<p>"But wait a bit, my old friend," chuckled
Eugene; "there are two kinds of torture, that of
the body, and of the mind!"</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right, sir," the little scientist
remarked; "but honestly, now, I fail to understand
the drift of your remarks."</p>

<p>"Then it shall be my pleasure to enlighten
you, Professor," Eugene continued. "Pay attention
to me now, and you will quickly have the
cataract removed from your eyes. Is there anything
in the world that you value above that
document which you know by this time has suddenly
increased in value many times over?"</p>

<p>"I can think of but one thing&mdash;my daughter
Janice!" replied the other, quickly. "And she
is far beyond your reach in the East."</p>

<p>"Ah yes, quite true, Professor," the schemer
went on; "more's the pity. But I think you make
a mistake when you say that your daughter is
the only thing on earth you value above the million
that has suddenly dropped at your feet.
How about this, Professor?"</p>

<p>He evidently held something up, for the other
immediately uttered a startled cry.</p>

<p>"The manuscript of my forthcoming book on
the mysteries of the cliff dwellers of the Grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
Canyon! The hard work of three long years of
exile! A labor of love that I expected will place
my name among the front ranks of scientists!"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" sneered Eugene. "Just keep
back, Professor, please. My men are not in any
too pleasant a mood, and I would not answer for
what they might do to you if you made the first
effort to snatch this thing from my hands. Sit
down again, and let us reason together."</p>

<p>"You wretch! Now I begin to see your game.
You would threaten to destroy all my precious
work of years, in order to obtain a miserable
paper."</p>

<p>At that Eugene laughed loudly.</p>

<p>"It may be all you say, Professor," he remarked;
"but it represents a snug little fortune
that I'd like to possess. The future would be
mighty pleasant, once I made that fine hit. And
if it appears like so much trash in your eyes, my
dear man, there should no longer be any hesitation
about giving it up to me. Think of the work
you have done. It couldn't be replaced, Professor,
I imagine? If now I should deliberately take
a match out of my pocket like this, strike the same,
and apply the busy little flame to these papers, the
history of the Zunis, the Hopis, the Moquis, and
their ancestors the cliff dwellers, would be forever
lost to the world, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Stop, you wretch!" cried the excited hermit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
who was apparently greatly alarmed at seeing his
precious manuscript in peril.</p>

<p>"Ah! do you then consent to open your mouth,
and tell what I want to know?" demanded his
tormentor.</p>

<p>"Is there no other way out?" asked the
prisoner of the cave, hopelessly.</p>

<p>"None," replied Eugene, harshly. "My men
are watching for the Moqui to show up every
second, and with orders to shoot him on sight.
So don't indulge in any hope that he can save
you. There, the match has burned itself out;
but remember, Professor, there are others, plenty
of them, where that came from. I will give you
one minute to produce that paper."</p>

<p>The scientist uttered a sigh that was plainly
heard.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must yield to fate then," he said,
dismally. "But you promise to return my papers
to me after I have complied with your outrageous
demands?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I will, and only too gladly," replied
the other, eagerly. "I don't want to make
the terms too hard on you, old man. Only you
must choose now between losing either the
fortune, or your work of years. And perhaps
we'd find the document after all, too. Speak
up; where is it?"</p>

<p>"Examine that rock stool on which you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
seated, and you will find that it can be moved,"
the voice of the hermit went on, steadily. "There,
now that you have over-turned the seat, you discover
something in the cavity. Keep your word,
and place in my hands my precious packet of
manuscript. Threats of taking my life might not
move me; but when you place in peril that on
which my reputation as a scientist must be based,
it is too much. Thank you, sir; I see you are a
man of your word. And I will sign the papers
just as you may wish to have done."<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

<h3>TURNING THE TABLES&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>

<br />

<p>"Come on in, boys!"</p>

<p>Old Hank Coombs had stood all the while this
intensely interesting dialogue was going on, as
though glued to the spot. Indeed, not one of the
party in the adjoining apartment of the cliff dwellers'
cave but who had kept drinking in the conversation
as though it fairly fascinated them.</p>

<p>But when the old cow puncher realized that to
all appearances the outrageous scheme of Eugene
had worked only too well, and that the precious
document was even then in the hands of the
smooth-tongued plotter, he suddenly awoke to
the fact that perhaps they had waited a little too
long.</p>

<p>Through the opening that served as a doorway
between the apartments he jumped, followed
immediately by Chesty, the two sheriffs, and finally
the saddle boys, with Charley Moi bringing up
the rear.</p>

<p>Of course their unexpected coming created
quite a breeze among those whom they thus surprised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
The little man who wore the goggles
seemed delighted, and immediately started to
place himself, and his precious manuscript, in a
position where he might be covered by these
welcome allies.</p>

<p>Spanish Joe and Abajo had started to draw
their weapons; but when they discovered that they
had already been covered, and recognized several
among the newcomers as old companions on
Circle Ranch, they promptly elevated their hands.</p>

<p>Eugene looked just as ugly as he felt. The
prize had apparently been about to fall into his
hands, like a ripe apple, when this change of front
had to occur.</p>

<p>He kept his wits about him, however, and like
the shrewd fox that he was, played the game to
the limit for his own safety.</p>

<p>"Keep your friends back, Professor Oswald!"
he shouted, as he managed to interpose what
looked like a stone table between himself and
the two sheriffs, who had their hungry eyes on
him. "See here, unless you promise on your
word of honor not to proceed against me for this
little game that didn't work, I'll tear this paper
that's worth a million into little bits, no matter
what happens to me afterwards! Do you hear,
Professor?"</p>

<p>Frank caught his breath. After all the hard
work which he and Bob had put in to save that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
precious document for Janice, was it to be lost?</p>

<p>He wanted to fly at the man, and snatch it
from his hands; but did not dare; for only too
well did he know that at the first hostile move
Eugene would proceed to put his threat into execution.</p>

<p>To his intense surprise the little man with the
big glasses seemed to be shaking as with a convulsion
of laughter. It did not seem as though
he worried about the fate of the document
Eugene held so rigidly, while awaiting an answer
to his demand.</p>

<p>"Do just as you please about that, my friend,"
chuckled the scientist. "If it would afford you
any enjoyment to destroy the paper you are holding,
I wouldn't cheat you out of it for the world."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" stammered the defeated plotter, "it
would render void all your right to taking possession
of the San Bernardino mine, if this document
were destroyed!"</p>

<p>"Oh! dear no, not at all," exclaimed the other,
cheerily. "The fact is, that paper is even now on
the way to the nearest post office, addressed to
my friend and relative, Colonel Haywood, and is
to go by registered mail."</p>

<p>"That Moqui Indian&mdash;" gasped Eugene, falling
back helplessly.</p>

<p>"Exactly, he carries the packet, with orders to
let nothing divert him from his one purpose," observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
the scientist; while Bob nudged his chum
in the side, unable to restrain his delight over the
wonderful outcome of the knotty problem.</p>

<p>"How did he get out of here?" asked Eugene.
"We watched the stone stairway every minute of
the time, and he didn't go down that way."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, in my prowling around here, month
after month," explained the hermit, "I managed
to find a way the old cliff dwellers had for reaching
the summit of the rocks, in case of necessity.
The Moqui possessed the nerve required to crawl
along the face of the cliff on a narrow ledge, and
make the exit. He is miles away by now, and my
daughter's inheritance is safe!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;this paper here," asked Eugene, faintly;
yet with curiosity governing his actions;
"it seems to be a legal document, transferring
a majority of the shares of the San Bernardino
mine over to you if the further conditions are fulfilled
within a certain time?"</p>

<p>"To be sure," laughed the other, "that was
the first copy, you might say. There was some
little defect about it, which we discovered after it
was signed; so a second copy was made. If you
had examined that one closer you would have
found that the stamp necessary to make it legal
was lacking. Somehow I happened to keep both
copies, never dreaming how valuable this bogus
one might prove."</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>

<p>Eugene threw the paper angrily to the floor.</p>

<p>"I'm done!" he cried, shaking his head.
"Come on, Mr. Stanwix, if you are after me, and
put the irons on; though I don't think you've got
any show of convicting me of any unlawful game.
I claim to have come here to interview this famous
old gentleman about the wonderful discoveries
he has made connected with these people of
the cliffs. I expected to make a big sum in selling
the article to a magazine. Perhaps you might
give me more or less trouble if you cared; but
then it's another thing to show proof. And the
professor wouldn't like to stay out here long
months, waiting for the case to come on."</p>

<p>"That's where you're right, my tall friend,"
chirped the little scientist; "and as my work is
almost finished I do not mean to let anything detain
me from getting my book in the hands of the
printers."</p>

<p>"Hear that, Mr. Stanwix; he says we're going
to get off easy, and you might as well wish us
good day right now?" exclaimed Eugene, nodding
to the Yavapai sheriff, whom he appeared
to know.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no hurry," remarked that
official, pleasantly. "On the whole, my opinion is
that it would be good policy to keep you locked
up until we know that the document has reached
the hands of the one to whom it was sent, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
who is, I believe, the father of our friend, Frank,
here."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Mr. Sheriff!" declared the
old hermit of the cave. "Because if he were set
free I fear he would chase after the United States
mail, if a single hope remained of stealing my
property. Yes, kindly keep him by you until I
come around with news."</p>

<p>Then he turned to the two cow punchers, who
had stood moodily by, listening to all that was
being said.</p>

<p>"I have no use for either of you men," he remarked,
shaking a finger at them; "so the sooner
you get down out of this place, the better. And
while I continue to remain here a few days, I'm
going to ask these brave lads to keep me company
as a guard of honor. I've many things to show
that may interest them. And I want to accompany
Frank to his home a little later, if possible."</p>

<p>And so it was arranged. Old Hank and Chesty
declared that their orders had been to stay as long
as Frank and Bob did; so they also took up their
quarters in the apartments that went to make up
what the little old gentleman had called Echo
Cave.</p>

<p>The two sheriffs took their prisoner away, to
place him in some secure nook while they continued
their search for the pair of scoundrels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>
whom they had hunted so long, and were determined
to get this time.</p>

<p>As they will not be seen again in this story it
may only be right to say that Frank afterwards
read an account in a paper of how the sheriffs
finally rounded up the Arizona Kid and Big Bill
Guffey, arresting them after a warm resistance
in which all of the participants were wounded.
And in due time doubtless the bad men who had
so long defied the law, paid the penalty for their
various crimes.</p>

<p>The saddle boys certainly did enjoy the few
days they spent with the queer little hermit, while
he completed his odd business in the rock dwellings
of the ancient cliff men.</p>

<p>They found the echo which had caused him to
give the place its name, and spent many an hour
amusing themselves with its astonishing power
to send back sounds.</p>

<p>Finally Havasupai made his appearance, bearing
with him a receipt, which proved that the precious
packet had been sent by registered mail to
Circle Ranch.</p>

<p>And then the professor announced himself as
ready to take his departure from the scene of his
two years' labors as a hermit, working in the interests
of science.</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful old place," Bob declared as
they took their last look at the Grand Canyon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
from the bluff in front of the hotel, ere mounting
their horses and starting back home across
the many miles that lay to the south and east
before Circle Ranch might be reached.</p>

<p>"Yes, and we'll never forget what we've seen
here," added Frank.</p>

<p>"Not to speak of the adventures that have
come our way," remarked Bob. "Tell you the
truth, Frank, I'll be mighty sorry when our trip
is over, because I reckon it'll be a long time before
we have another chance for such a great
gallop."</p>

<p>But although of course he did not know it just
then, Bob was very much mistaken when he made
this prophecy. It happened that events were
shaping themselves at that very hour in a way
calculated to call upon the saddle boys to make
another venture into the realms of chance, and
mounted upon their prized horses too. What
these events were, and how well Frank and Bob
acquitted themselves when brought face to face
with new adventures, will be found set forth in
the next volume of this series, under the title of,
"The Saddle Boys on the Plains; Or, After a
Treasure of Gold."</p>

<p>Old Hank and Chesty accompanied Professor
Oswald by way of the railroad to a point nearest
the ranch, where a vehicle would be awaiting
them. He had been greatly interested in hearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
how one of the bottles that he had thrown
into the swift current of the Colorado had been
eventually picked up in far distant Mohave City;
and thus his note came into the hands of his relatives.</p>

<p>Of course Frank and his chum enjoyed the return
gallop even more than when on the way to
the Grand Canyon. They no longer had anything
weighing on their minds, since the plans of
Eugene Warringford had been broken up. And
besides, the recollection of the astounding
wonders they had gazed upon in that great canyon
were bound to haunt them forever.</p>

<p>The little professor was waiting to see them
at the ranch, before starting East to join his
daughter, and get his wonderful book under
way.</p>

<p>"I owe you boys more than I can tell," he
declared, when he was saying good-bye; "and
you needn't be at all surprised if a nice little
bunch of gold mine stock comes this way for each
of you, just as soon as my deal goes through,
which will be in one more week."</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, and when the
mine came under his authority he did send both
Frank and Bob some stock, on which they could
collect dividends four times a year.</p>

<p>Frank looked in vain for the coming of the old
Moqui. Charley Moi did indeed turn up a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
later, anxious to again meet the boys whom he
had served in the Grand Canyon. But Havasupai
came not to Circle Ranch; and remembering
how he had apparently been fleeing from
the wrath of his people at the time they first met
him, Frank and Bob could not but wonder
whether the old warrior had gone back to his
native village only to meet his fate at the hands
of his people, according to Moqui law.</p>

<p>Here we may leave our two young friends, the
saddle boys, for a short time, enjoying a well
earned rest. But the lure of the great outdoors
was so strongly rooted in their natures that it
may be readily understood they could not remain
inactive long; but would soon be galloping over
the wide reaches, following the cowboys as they
rounded up the herds, branded mavericks and
young cattle, and picked out those intended for
shipment to the great marts at Kansas City.</p>

<p>But while new scenes would likely interest
Frank and Bob from time to time, they could
never forget the magnificent views that had been
stamped upon their memories forever while in the
Grand Canyon of the mighty Colorado.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span></p>

</div><br /><br />

<p class="center"><b>FOUR BOY HUNTERS</b><br />
<i>Or, The Outing of the Gun Club</i></p>

<p>A fine, breezy story of the woods and
waters, of adventures in search of
game, and of great times around the campfire,
told in Captain Bonehill's best style.
In the book are given full directions for
camping out.</p><br />

<p class="center"><b>GUNS AND SNOWSHOES</b><br />
<i>Or, The Winter Outing of the Young Hunters</i></p>

<p>In this volume the young hunters leave home for a winter outing on the
shores of a small lake. They hunt and trap to their hearts' content,
and have adventures in plenty, all calculated to make boys "sit up and
take notice." A good healthy book; one with the odor of the pine forests
and the glare of the welcome campfire in every chapter.</p><br />

<p class="center"><b>YOUNG HUNTERS OF THE LAKE</b><br />
<i>Or, Out with Rod and Gun</i></p>

<p>Another tale of woods and waters, with some strong hunting scenes and
a good deal of mystery. The three volumes make a splendid outdoor series.</p><br />

<p class="center"><b>OUT WITH GUN AND CAMERA</b><br />
<i>Or, The Boy Hunters in the Mountains</i></p>

<p>Takes up the new fad of photographing wild animals as well as
shooting them. An escaped circus chimpanzee and an escaped lion
add to the interest of the narrative.</p><br />
